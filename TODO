TODO (order is not significant)
===========

  List of things TODO is now kept at sourceforge

      http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=65612&atid=511615

  There you can monitor the feature(s) you are interested in and
  get automatic feedback when they are under work, under test, completely
  implementation or released.

  Bugs report should still go to the Bug tracker
  and support request to the dar-support mailing-list
