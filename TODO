TODO (order is not significant)
===========
- have wild card for -f and -r options of dar_manager
- add a 'testing' option for dar_manager's databases
- have the possibility to define a given compression algo + level by file type and be able to merge archive using different compressions
- have dar_manager able to read encrypted archives, and encrypt databases
- having null terminated string in -B files
- escape character for quotes in -B files
- LZO compression (poor documentation... need time to read how is done the implementation in lzop)
- warning when an explicit file from -g or -P option has not been found
- add create_diff and create_full syntaxical target in dcf files
- have makefile-like user targets
- have "reference" target (once a -A option is given). [Same as create_diff / create_full]
- have a minimum block size for compression, under which files are compressed
toghether, size would be user defined.
- some more encryption cypher
- Matthew's "dry martini" option ;-)
- parchive inside libdar
- API feature : have a method to return information about the listed archive (additional method, when not using op_listing)
- hard links support to pipes soft links and directory
- error when path contains spaces (#1117188) with autoconf/automake
- prevoir revue de code module par module avec consideration des aspects :
  - robustesse (protection des exceptions et des cas possibles d'erreurs)
  - messages a traduire (gettext)
  - documentation (commentaires et doxygen)
  - simplification du code (converstions inutiles, mise en facteur commun...)
  - optimisation memoire et vitesse
- decremental backup feature (-> merging with overwrite)
- option to only process file removal at restoration time (do not restore data)
- remember the cypher used (algorithm chosen for encryption stored inside the archive)
  this way user does only have to use the password/passphrase
- binary diff when file size exceed a given size (no diff by default)
- suppress the summary information at the end of the backup (with -q option)
- "path" like variable to look for slices (George Foot's original idea)
- vesionning of *.mo files to be able to have several versions of libdar installed
- remove all generated files from CVS (./configure & so ON, make dev snapshot available from web).
- optimize search in directory when there is at least several hundred files
