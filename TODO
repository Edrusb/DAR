TODO (order is not significant)
===========
- have wild card for -f and -r options of dar_manager
- add a 'testing' option for dar_manager's databases
- have the possibility to define a given compression algo + level by file type
- have dar_manager able to read encrypted archives, and encrypt databases
- have -X -I -P read a list from a given file
- having null terminated string in -B files
- escape character for quotes in -B files
- rewrite all documentation in HTML
- LZO compression (poor documentation... need time to read how is done the implementation in lzop)
- extend EA to xfs and trusted. Replace "root" EA name by "system" EA name (source code, comments, doc)
- warning when an explicit file from [list of path] has not been found
- dar_manager can restore all files at the state it was at a given time (Uwe Freese's original idea, on support forum)
- add create_diff and create_full syntaxical target in dcf files
- have a minimum block size for compression, under which files are compressed
  toghether, size is user defined.
- having a new action: the "snapshot" to catalogue (only contains informations about the current status of files)
- deprecate [list of path] warn and redirect with -g option (open the make-like target syntax)
- some more encryption cypher
- Matthew's "dry martini" option ;-)
- parchive inside libdar
- have the possibility to abort (^C) dar_manager at any time without the risk of loosing the database
- API feature : have a method to return information about the listed archvie (additional method, when not using op_listing)
- API feature : have cypher used stored in the archive and automatically detect the cypher used when reading an archive
- dar_manager uses temporary files to limit the period of "all in memory" information when writing back database to file.
