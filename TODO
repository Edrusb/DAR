TODO (order is not significant)
===========
- libdar library thread safe
- multi-language support (selection at compilation time)
- rethink the behavior of dar when virtual memory is exhausted
  (do not fail stop asking the user whether to retry or stop, thus the routine
   must not need extra memory to work)
- have wild card for -f and -r options of dar_manager
- check the apache "Order" directive for command-line more grained inclusion/exclusion mechanism
- add a 'testing' option for dar_manager's databases
- have the possibility to define a given compression algo + level by file type
- add EA support for xfs filesystem
- add KiB and KB
- add long-options under Solaris and on other system that do not provide it.
- add examples of use for -I -X -P and [list of path]
- have dar_manager able to read encrypted archives, and encrypt databases
- generic_file based read or write caching. to use around catalogue
  (catalogue::catalogue(generic_file) constructor and catalogue::dump(generic_file) or better in the "none" algorithm for compressor
- long options on all systems.
