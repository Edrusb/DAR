TODO (order is not significant)
===========
- bzip2 compression
- API for Graphical User Interface(s) 
- multi-language support (selection at compilation time)
- bootable Linux image with what's necessary to restore a system from a dar
  archive
- provide minimum file size parameter below which no compression is performed
- change the packaging to have a "configure" script (thanks to Tim Doerzbacher)
- rethink the behaviour of dar when virtual memory is exhausted 
  (do not fail stop asking the user whether to retry or stop, thus the routine
   must not need extra memory to work) 
- add a feature that skips directory structure while restoring a 
  "--flat" option as suggested by Rgbtxus.
- be able to use -I and -X while listing archive contents.
