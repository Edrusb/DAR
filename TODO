TODO (order is not significant)
===========
- add encryption capability
- bzip2 compression
- Graphical User Interface for Linux
- Windows Port
- multi-language support (selection at compilation time)
- understand when a filename is given in place of a basename and take out 
  the base name asking the user for processing
- mask feature to not compress certain files base on filename mask
- add time shift for differential backup, when daylight saving causes problem
- support for reading configuration from a file instead of command-line
- bootable Linux image with what's necessary to restore a system from a dar
  archive
- add a hook to launch a given shell command/script when a slice has been written
- add a mode in which dar does not change the atime of directory it is openning 
  for reading during a backup (some software like "leafnode" --- a NNTP proxy, 
  rely on the atime of directories for proper operation).
