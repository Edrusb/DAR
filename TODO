TODO (order is not significant)
===========
- API for Graphical User Interface(s)
- libdar library (thread safe)
- multi-language support (selection at compilation time)
- bootable Linux image with what's necessary to restore a system from a dar
  archive
- change the packaging to have a "configure" script (thanks to Tim Doerzbacher)
- rethink the behaviour of dar when virtual memory is exhausted 
  (do not fail stop asking the user whether to retry or stop, thus the routine
   must not need extra memory to work) 
- make light limited version of dar_suite, based over 64 bits integers
- have wilde card for -f and -r options of dar_manager
- standart batch options examples (non compressible file extensions, etc).
- avoid cursor key to be considered as escape key.
- add a FEC or similar layer for data recovery.
? infinint.cpp  read_from_file(S_I <-> int)
? remove the information of command line used for backup, put a developped list (from included files) before running.
- consider a FEC algo to use bellow class sar (to protect slice header from medium error).
