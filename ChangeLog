from version 1.0.0 to version 1.0.1
- correction of few mistakes that lead the compilation to fail with certain
      C++ compilers
- bug #1 fixed.

from version 1.0.1 to version 1.0.2
- bug #2 fixed
- bug #3 fixed

from version 1.0.2 to version 1.0.3
- bug #5 fixed

from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0
- added feature: now ignored directory are not stored at all in the archive
      unless -D option is used, in which case ignored directory are recorded as
      empty directory (as it was in 1.0.x)
- added support for hard links. Generated archive format version is now 02, but
      format 01 can still be read, and use as reference.
- fixed bug #1
- fixed bug #2
- fixed bug #3
- added feature: restore only more recent file than existing one (-r option)
- added feature: support for Extended Attributes (activated at compilation)
- added feature: verbose option (-v) with -l (add archive contents)
- modified behavior: -l option without -v is no more interactive
- added feature: archive integrity test (option -t). CRC have been added in
      the archive (format 02), thus even without compression Dar is able to
      detect errors.
- added feature: comparison with filesystem (difference) (option -d)
- modified behavior: non interactive messages goes to stdout, while those
      asking user, goes to stderr (all goes to stderr if stdout is used for
      producing the archive, or for sending orders do dar_slave.
- added feature: DAR automatically goes in non interactive mode if no terminal
      is found on standard input (for example when run from crontab). In that
      case any question make DAR to abort.
- added feature: catalogue extraction to small file: "isolation" (-C option)
- added feature: archive produced on stdout when using -c or -C with "-" as
      filename
- added feature: -V option summarizes version of the binary
- added feature: additional command "dar_xform" to "re-slice" an archive
- added feature: read archive trough a pair of pipes with the help of dar_slave
- added feature: long option are now available (see man page)
- fixed bug #5
- a lot of speed optimization in algorithm
- changed exit codes to positive values in case of error
- dar returns an new error code when an operation is partially successful
  (some filed missed to be saved / restored / tested / compared).
- replace the use of vform() method by a customized simple implementation
  in the ui_printf() routine, this should now allow compilation with gcc-3
- changed long option that used an underscore character (`_') by a dash ('-')
- added -O option to have a better behavior when used with non root user
- added 'make doc' option in the makefile

from version 1.1.0 to version 1.2.0

  more similar to the output of tar. -T is provided to get the previous tree
  listing

- user interaction is now possible even if standard input is used (for pipe)
- fixed bug #7
- added some missing #include files for compilation under Windows using Cygwin
- added feature to display name of user and group (when possible) in place of
  uid and gid while listing archive contents.
- added the possibility to launch command between slices (-E and -F options)
  for dar, dar_xform and dar_slave.
- when saving or comparing a directory tree, DAR goes transparently in
  subdirectory not modifying the last_access date of each directory.
- usage text (displayed by -h option) is now generated from xml file
  thanks to Chris Martin's little software named dar-help
- fixed bug concerning the uninstallation of man pages
- changed the place where man pages and documentation go /usr/share/doc
  usr/share/man
  in place of /usr/doc and /usr/man for the RPM package (conform to Filesystem
  Hierarchy Standard)
- changed the place where documentation goes for /usr/local/doc to
  /usr/local/share/doc by default. (Thanks to Jerome Zago)
  (conform to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)
- added scrambling features (-J and -K options)
- added selective compression (-Y and -Z options)
- added third state for saved data to keep trace in an extracted catalogue of
  what is saved in the reference archive (this opens the door to the archive
  manager)
- added the ability to read configuration file (-B option, -B like "batch").
- if a slice name is given in place of a base name, dar proposes to change
  to the correct base name (strips the extension number and dots).
- fixed bug #8
- added dar_manager command-line program
- replaced integer types by macro that can be adapted to have correct behavior
  on 64 bits platform (in particular to read archive from other platforms).

from version 1.2.0 to version 1.2.1
- minor change to have backward compatibility with old archive (dar < 1.2.0)
generated on 64 bits OS (have to use OS_BITS=32 in Makefile on 64 bits OS).
- adapted Axel Kohlmeyer's patch for RPMS
- adapted Dietrich Rothe's patch for compression level : -z has an optional
  argument which is compression level to use.
- I and -X now available while listing archive contents (-l)
- based on Brian May's patch, dar with EA_SUPPORT avoids complaining when
  reading a filesystem that do not supports EA.

  hard link seen on an inode was displayed in place of the name of each hard
  link). This did not concern the tree (-T option) listing.
- added standard config files ~/.darrrc and /etc/darrc config files
- conditional statements in included files (using make-like targets)
- added feature : --noconf option
- fixed a bug : warning message issued when th user asks for dar to backup
  the archive in itself, was not displayed in some cases.

- added total files counter in each archive while listing dar_manager database
- fixed bug #12

  messages are sent there.
- changed "dar_manager -u" do not display anymore files present in the archive
  which have not saved data or EA in the asked archive.
- removed displaying of command-line used for backup ("dar -v -l ...") as it
  is no more becoming inaccurate due to include files and as it would consume
  too much space if it has to be developed.

- adapted Wesley's patch for a pkgconfig for libdar
- added -[ and -] options (file selection from file listing)
  Important consequence for libdar user programs:
  the fs_root argument is now expanded to full absolute path inside libdar,
  thus the mask you will give for path inclusion/exclusion (the "subtree" argument)
  will be used against full absolute path of files under consideration
  for the operation. Assuming you have fs_root=tmp/A and the current
  directory is /tmp, your mask will be used against strings like
  /var/tmp/A/some/file. (instead of tmp/A/some/file as in the previous API
  version). Things are equal if the fs_root is given an absolute path.
- changed archive format to "05". Due to complete review of EA management.
- upon some signal reception, dar aborts the backup nicely, producing a
  completely formatted archive will all the file saved so far. This archive can
  be take as reference for a further backup to continue the operation at a later
  time.
- dar_manager aborts properly upon certain signal reception (do not let the database
  partially updated).
- dar_slave and dar_xform now recognize when a slicename is given in place of a basename

- dar_manager can now restore files based on a given date (not always the most recent version)
- dar_manager now has an interactive mode (-i option)
- change in API, the warning() method need not be overwritten, but the new protected method
  inherited_warning() must be inherited in its place (same function, same prototype
  as the original warning() method).
- dar_manager features are now part of libdar. API has been completed with these new features
- added the "last_slice" context (%c with -E option) when creating an archive
- dar now check a file has not been modified while it was reading it, if so it reports a warning and returns a specific exit code
- remove included gettext from the package (it is more a source of conflict with external gettext and if somebody needs internationalization better is to install libintl/gettext on its own).
- added George Foot feedback about the good backup practice sort guide.
- added -e option to dar_manager
- added the progressive_report feature in the API
- dar can now pause every N slice where N >= 1

- fixed a bug that appeared when a file is removed while at the time it is saved by dar
- avoid having an unnecessary warning appearing when restoring a file in a directory that has default EA set
- Cygwin has changed and does not support anymore the path in the form "c:/some/where", you have to use "/cygdrive/c/some/where" instead. Documentation has been updated in consequence.

- added a check to verify that the libdar used is compatible with the current
  dar suite programs [SF #1587643]
- fixed bug: added workaround for the right arithmetic shift operator (the
  binary produced by gcc-3.4.2 produces computes "v>>s" equal to "v" when when
  v is a integer field composed of s exactly bits. It should rather compute it
  to zero...).
  this problem leads 32 bits generated archive incompatible with 64 bits
  generated archive only when blowfish is used.
- fixed bug met when the inode space is exhausted, thanks to "Jo - Ex-Bart" for
  this new feedback. [SF #1632738]

- added an error message when an include/exclude file listing does not
  contains an invalid path (instead of a self reported bug message).
- modified message displayed when some slice of an old archive having the
  same name are present in the destination directory (backup, isolation, merging,
  dar_xform)
