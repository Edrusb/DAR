from version 1.0.0 to version 1.0.1
- correction of few mistakes that lead the compilation to fail with certain
      C++ compilers
- bug #1 fixed.

from version 1.0.1 to version 1.0.2
- bug #2 fixed
- bug #3 fixed

from version 1.0.2 to version 1.0.3
- bug #5 fixed

from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0
- added feature: now ignored directory are not stored at all in the archive
      unless -D option is used, in which case ignored directory are recorded as
      empty directory (as it was in 1.0.x)
- added support for hard links. Generated archive format version is now 02, but
      format 01 can still be read, and use as reference.
- fixed bug #1
- fixed bug #2
- fixed bug #3
- added feature: restore only more recent file than existing one (-r option)
- added feature: support for Extended Attributes (activated at compilation)
- added feature: verbose option (-v) with -l (add archive contents)
- modified behavior: -l option without -v is no more interactive
- added feature: archive integrity test (option -t). CRC have been added in
      the archive (format 02), thus even without compression Dar is able to
      detect errors.
- added feature: comparison with filesystem (difference) (option -d)
- modified behavior: non interactive messages goes to stdout, while those
      asking user, goes to stderr (all goes to stderr if stdout is used for
      producing the archive, or for sending orders do dar_slave.
- added feature: DAR automatically goes in non interactive mode if no terminal
      is found on standard input (for example when run from crontab). In that
      case any question make DAR to abort.
- added feature: catalogue extraction to small file: "isolation" (-C option)
- added feature: archive produced on stdout when using -c or -C with "-" as
      filename
- added feature: -V option summarizes version of the binary
- added feature: additional command "dar_xform" to "re-slice" an archive
- added feature: read archive trough a pair of pipes with the help of dar_slave
- added feature: long option are now available (see man page)
- fixed bug #5
- a lot of speed optimization in algorithm
- changed exit codes to positive values in case of error
- dar returns an new error code when an operation is partially successful
  (some filed missed to be saved / restored / tested / compared).
- replace the use of vform() method by a customized simple implementation
  in the ui_printf() routine, this should now allow compilation with gcc-3
- changed long option that used an underscore character (`_') by a dash ('-')
- added -O option to have a better behavior when used with non root user
- added 'make doc' option in the makefile

from version 1.1.0 to version 1.2.0
- -P option can now accept wild cards
- changed dar output format when listing archive contents to have something
  more similar to the output of tar. -T is provided to get the previous tree
  listing
- fixed bug #6
- user interaction is now possible even if standard input is used (for pipe)
- fixed bug #7
- added some missing #include files for compilation under Windows using Cygwin
- added feature to display name of user and group (when possible) in place of
  uid and gid while listing archive contents.
- added the possibility to launch command between slices (-E and -F options)
  for dar, dar_xform and dar_slave.
- when saving or comparing a directory tree, DAR goes transparently in
  subdirectory not modifying the last_access date of each directory.
- usage text (displayed by -h option) is now generated from xml file
  thanks to Chris Martin's little software named dar-help
- fixed bug concerning the uninstallation of man pages
- changed the place where man pages and documentation go /usr/share/doc
  usr/share/man
  in place of /usr/doc and /usr/man for the RPM package (conform to Filesystem
  Hierarchy Standard)
- changed the place where documentation goes for /usr/local/doc to
  /usr/local/share/doc by default. (Thanks to Jerome Zago)
  (conform to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)
- added scrambling features (-J and -K options)
- added selective compression (-Y and -Z options)
- added third state for saved data to keep trace in an extracted catalogue of
  what is saved in the reference archive (this opens the door to the archive
  manager)
- added the ability to read configuration file (-B option, -B like "batch").
- if a slice name is given in place of a base name, dar proposes to change
  to the correct base name (strips the extension number and dots).
- fixed bug #8
- added dar_manager command-line program
- replaced integer types by macro that can be adapted to have correct behavior
  on 64 bits platform (in particular to read archive from other platforms).

from version 1.2.0 to version 1.2.1
- minor change to have backward compatibility with old archive (dar < 1.2.0)
generated on 64 bits OS (have to use OS_BITS=32 in Makefile on 64 bits OS).
- adapted Axel Kohlmeyer's patch for RPMS
- adapted Dietrich Rothe's patch for compression level : -z has an optional
  argument which is compression level to use.
- I and -X now available while listing archive contents (-l)
- based on Brian May's patch, dar with EA_SUPPORT avoids complaining when
  reading a filesystem that do not supports EA.
- based on Brian May's other patch, dar now uses by default the <stdint.h>
  integers.
- dar is now built with dynamic linking, and a special version named
  dar_static which is statically linked is also available
- fixed problem on Windows NT & 2000 (fixed by first change above)

from version 1.2.1 to 1.3.0
- added parenthesis for a warning to be able to show, when opening a
  scrambled archive
- fixed bug #10
- added feature : --flat option
- improved slice name detection when given in place of archive basename
- added feature : comments in the configuration file given to -B (see
  man page for more).
- added feature : --mincompr option
- fixed a display error when listing a hard link (the name of the first
  hard link seen on an inode was displayed in place of the name of each hard
  link). This did not concern the tree (-T option) listing.
- added standard config files ~/.darrrc and /etc/darrc config files
- conditional statements in included files (using make-like targets)
- added feature : --noconf option
- fixed a bug : warning message issued when th user asks for dar to backup
  the archive in itself, was not displayed in some cases.
- fixed bug #11
- added total files counter in each archive while listing dar_manager database
- fixed bug #12
- improved slicename versus basename substitution warning and replacement.
- changed internal name generation to avoid using std::sstream class
- bzip2 compression implemented (need libbz2 library at compilation time)
- added the --nodump feature
- fixed bug #13
- configuration file can have DOS or UNIX text formating
- now closing files before asking for the last slice, this allow un-mounting
  filesystem in that case.

  messages are sent there.
- changed "dar_manager -u" do not display anymore files present in the archive
  which have not saved data or EA in the asked archive.
- removed displaying of command-line used for backup ("dar -v -l ...") as it
  is no more becoming inaccurate due to include files and as it would consume
  too much space if it has to be developed.

- now displaying option read from configuration files when using -v option
- added %e and %c for user script parameters
- using UPX to compress binary if available at compilation time

  the archive itself. This revealed a bug, which made the warning be
  issued in some wrong cases.

- fixed bug #15
- fixed error in libdar sanity checks, where exceptions were not raised (due
  to the lack of the "throw" keyword)
