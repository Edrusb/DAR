version 1.2.0
---------------
Thanks to Chris Martin, Jerome Zago, Tim Doerzbacher, Sebastien Robart, 
Kurt Palmer, Bernd Storsberg, Egor Cheshkov, Richard Bratt for feedback
and suggestions.

I must add a special Thanks to Chris Martin who realized a simple and 
efficient tool that generates the usage C++ code from files writen in XML 
syntax, making automatic word wrapping and indentation. This power tool
named "dar-help" is licensed as part of DAR, but has been totally designed 
and written by Chris.


version 1.1.0

Thanks to Moritz Franosch for intensive testing, for finding several bugs and 
proposing patches, to John Little for testing dar and for providing a forum 
area, to Ulrich Hagen, Francois Botha, Tobias Jahn for feedback, and to 
Andreas Gruenbacher for its Extended Attributes software, and its useful 
answers to my questions. Thanks to the many other people that just encouraged 
me by their remarks and compliments.
