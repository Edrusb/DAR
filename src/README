What will you find here ?

Source code for dar suite program.

libdar directory
  contains all code of dar that have been moved since version
  2.0.0 to a separated library known as libdar.

dar_suite directory
  contains all the rest of the code of dar, which is command-line specific

examples directory
  contains few programs that illustrate the use of infinint

libdl directory
  contains nothing. It has been added when porting dar to Solaris, having
  met some problem to build static version of dar. On this sytem the libdl
  library is not provided as a static version, only the dynamic version exists.
  For this reason static linking is not possible for dar. I was trying a work
  around to build a fake libdl library, but this failed. CVS cannot remove
  directories, thus libdl will stay here.

testing directory
  contains a pletor for very simple program that helped be validate each C++
  module of dar. They are to be used in step by step debugging and in
  conjunction with variable watch. This program are not intended to be used
  except by developers.
