    /// the class thread_cancellation implemented in this module
    /// permits to define checkpoints where is looked whether the current
    /// thread has been marked as to be canceled by the user
    /// The advantage of this class is that it then throws a Euser_abort
    /// exception which properly terminates the libdar operation in the thread
    /// freeing allocated memory and release mutex properly. Note that the thread
    /// is not canceled but libdar call in this thread returns as soon as a checkpoint
    /// is met during the execution.
