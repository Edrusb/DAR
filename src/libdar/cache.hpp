	/// the cache class implements a fixed length read/write caching mechanism
	///
	/// it is intended to reduce context switches when no compression is used
	/// and when reading or writing catalogue through a pipe. The catalogue
	/// read and write is done by calling dump/constructor methods of the many
	/// objects that a catalogue contains. This makes a lot of small reads or
    	/// writes, which make very poor performances when used over the network
	/// through a pipe to ssh. When compression is used, the problem disapears
	/// as the compression engine gather these many small reads or writes into
	/// much bigger ones. This in only when there is no compression or encryption
	/// that this class is useful (and used).
	/// Another target of class cache is to provide limited skippability when
	/// data is read of written to pipe (which do not have any skippability)
