	/// class semaphore

	/// Its action is to invoke the execute hook for each file that match the given mask
	/// Each file to backup has to be "raised()", which, if it matches the mask, leads
	/// to the execution of the execute hook with the proper substitution for that file
	/// in the "start" context.
	/// Then the backup can take place.
	/// When the backup is finished, the lower() method has to be called to trigger the
	/// execution of the hook with the proper substitution but in the "end" context.
	/// but, things are a bit complicated due to the handle of directories:
	/// If a directory is "raised()" and matches the mask, next calls to raise() do not trigger any
	/// hook execution even if the file match the mask, while saving into the directory
	/// that matched first. Instead, each new call to raise() increments an internal counter when
	/// a new directory is met, which is decremented when an "eod" is given to raised().
	/// So it is important to feed raise() with any entry may it has to be saved or not.
	/// while lower() has only to be called when a file has been saved.
	/// This is only when this internal counters reaches zero, that the lower() call will
	/// trigger the execution for this first matched directory, of the hook in the "end" context.
	///
	/// So the expected use is to give each file to be saved (including eod) to the raise()
	/// method, before eventually saving the file, and call the lower() method only for files that had to
	/// be saved once the backup is completed, may it be normally or due to an exception being thrown.
