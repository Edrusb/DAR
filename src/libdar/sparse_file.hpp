    /// this class is used to receive plain file's data to be written to the
    /// archive or to be read out from an archive. The class uses escape sequences
    /// to replace holes in files (long serie of zeros) by the number of zeros
    /// preceeded by a escape sequence mark.
    /// this class internally uses an escape object, with a modifed
    /// fixed escape sequence that optimizes the use of sparse_file objects with
    /// other escape objects.
