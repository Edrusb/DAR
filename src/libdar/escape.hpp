    /// \brief class escape definition, used for sequential reading of archives
    /// \ingroup Private
    ///
    /// The class escape is used to insert escape sequences before each new file's
    /// data in an archive. The normal file's data is also rewritten if it contains
    /// such an escape sequence for it does not collide with real escape sequences
    /// At reading time, this class revert backs modification done to file's data
    /// containing escape sequences for they contain the original data. This class
    /// also provides the feature to skip to the next (real) escape sequence.
    /// This class inherits of generic files and its objects are to be used in a
    /// stack of generic file's objects. The object below contains modified data
    /// and escape sequences, the file over gets the normal file data and does
    /// never see escape sequences. Expected implementation is to have a compressor
    /// above an escape object and a sar or scrambler/blowfish/... object above it.
