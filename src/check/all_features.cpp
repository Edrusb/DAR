    // strange() is an unused function that invokes three symbols defined in <libintl.h>
    // without this trick for some reason I still cannot understand, the linking fails on Cygwin
    // having libdar missing _libintl_bindtextdomain symbols to link with.
    // The point that is strange is that invoking these three symbols here do not lead to
    // define any associated _libintl_ prefixed symbols here, just to refer to them one more time,
    // so the linking of all_features should still fails! (while here it succeeds...)
    // Looking at <libintl.h> header files, it seems that three modes are available:
    // 1:  _INTL_REDIRECT_INLINE
    // 2:  _INTL_REDIRECT_MACROS
    // 3:  _INTL_REDIRECT_ASM
    // seen the output of g++ -E the option selected under Cygwin is the asm one when
    // compiling all_features.cpp as well as while compiling libdar, all three methods
    // make the gettext/textdomain/bindtextdomain to point (either by macro, inlined function,
    // or assembler definition to the associated _libintl_ prefixed function, which symbol
    // is missing at linking time while the -lint is properly given on command-line.
    // calling gettext/textdomain/bindtext in strange() below do not define any symbol
    // ... so why does it makes linking succeed? ... why does it fails else? I admin my
    // limited understanding here. Anyway, this fix works and has no impact at execution time
    // just making the all_feature.cpp binary slightly larger, binary that is only used
    // when invoking 'make check'.
