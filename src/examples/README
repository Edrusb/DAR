In this directory you will find some example programs.

what do they do ?


	factoriel

At the beginning it was a test program for infinint. It computes the factorial
of the given integer. If compiled without --enable-mode=... option given to
configure, it will always (should at least), return the decimal representation
of the asked decimal. The problem is more the time it will take to compute it.
And using --enable-mode=... you will get the message dar reports when integer
overflow has been detected.


	prime

tests if the given number is a prime factor. It relies on infinint. (also
a test program at the beginning).
