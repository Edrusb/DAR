In this directory you will find some example programs.

what do they do ?


	factoriel

At the beginning it was a test program for infinint. It computes the factorial
of the given integer. If compiled with --enable-mode=infinint option given to
./configure, it should always, return the decimal representation
of the asked decimal. The problem is more the time it will take to compute it.
And not using --enable-mode option you may get a message reporting that an integer
overflow has occurred.


	prime

tests if the given number is a prime factor. It relies on infinint. (also
a test program at the beginning).


       formula

calculate a simple arythmetic expression given as argument
