from 2.4.x to 2.5.0
- added support for posix_fadvise
- added entrepot class hierarchy
- added access to the entrepot through the API (new option)
- sar and archive now use entrepot
- dar_slave dar_xform uses entrepot_local
- split class fichier in two classes, class fichier_global is entrepot
  independent, class fichier stays tied to entrpot_local (backward
  compatible with former implementation)
- class hash_fichier becomes entrepot independent

from 2.4.6 to 2.4.7
- fixing memory allocation bug in crc class, that lead glibc aborting dar
- reviewed code and replaced some remaining occurences of bzero/bcopy by
  their recommended replacement version
- fixed compilation problem under Solaris
- fixed bug that could lead a file to be wrongly reported as different from the
  one on filesystem, when that file has been changed while it was saved, then
  saved a second time but has its size modified since the first time it was
  saved.

from 2.4.5 to 2.4.6
- fixed bug met while interrupting compressed archive creation, the resulting
  archive was only readable in --sequential-read mode
- fixed bug met while reading an interrupted archive in sequential reading
  mode. It lead dar to not release some objects from memory at the end of
  the operation, which displayed an ugly error message from libdar selfcheck
  routine.
- fixed message reporting unknown system group when converting gid to name
  (was reporting unknow "user" instead of unknown "group")
- removing the $Id:$ macro from file as we moved from CVS to GIT
- updating package to distribute Patrick Nagel's scripts and documentation
- updated URL pointing to Patrick Nagel's web site
- updating documentation describing how to get source code from GIT (no more
  from CVS)
- fixed typo in configure.ac
- added info on how to build a brand-new dar tarball from source in GIT
- modifies the end of messages shown by -h option to point to man page for
  more _options_ rather than _details_
- replaced &minus; in the HTML generated documentation by a standard ASCII dash
- fixed alignement bug in CRC calculation that lead libdar based application to
  crash on sparc-based systems.

from 2.4.4 to 2.4.5
- updated sample scripts to be compatible with dar's --min-digit option
- added missing included file to be able to compile with gcc-4.7.0
- removing an unused variable in filtre.cpp
- fixed a display bug when comparing archive with filesystem, leading to a
  segmentation fault (%S in place of %i in mask)
- fixed bug leading dar to not restore some directories from differential
  backups when they are absent in the filesystem
- fixed bug that show a "uncaught exception" message at the end of archive
  listing for dar shared binaries only, compiled in infinint mode, under
  ArchLinux
- updated the configure script to link with libexecinfo when available
- added possibility to disable the use of execinfo in libdar thanks to the
  new --disable-execinfo option for the ./configure script
- added Andreas Wolff patch to fix bug under Cygwin (segfault on program
  termination).

from 2.4.3 to 2.4.4
- fixed man pages in the NAME section: added whatis entry
- fixed segfault: in the internal error reporting code (delete[] in place of
  free())
- fixed bug: dar_manager was not able to read properly the latest generated
  databases version when having Extended Attributes recorded for some files
- avoided reporting unreleased memory block when compilation optimization
  have been used (dar, dar_manager, dar_cp, dar_slave, dar_xform do all
  reported unreleased memory when gcc optimization was used in "infinint" mode)

from 2.4.2 to 2.4.3
- fixed absurd compilation warning about possibly uninitialized variable
- added -ai switch to dar_manager to disable warning about improper file order
  in database.
- fixed bug met while changing order of archives in a dar_manager database
- avoiding concurrent use of -p and -Q options, error message shown in that
  situation.
- modified slice overwriting detection code to use a single atomic system call
  to create a new slice
- replaced delete by delete[] for conversion routine of user/group to uid/gid
- added the possibility to disable speed optimization for large directories
- added memory troubleshooting option --enable-debug-memory
- simplified class CRC implementation
- fixed failed memory release upon exception thrown in class deci
- modified tlv, tlv_list classes and ea_filesystem routines to not require
  any corresponding temporary objects in libdar (saves a few new/delete calls)
- fixed silent bug in tlv class: due to the absence of copy constructor and
  destructor, some memory was not released and referred after the corresponding
  object's destruction
- modified generic_file class to avoid temporary crc objects
- fixed bug in header class that lead unreleased field (this class lacked a
  destructor), memory impact was however little: 10 bytes per slice
- fixing bug in class tlv: unreleased memory
- added protection code in class deci to properly release memory against
  exception thrown from called routines when user interrupts the operation.
- replace previous internal stack report code by backtrace()/backtrace_symbols()
- complete change of the implementation of the 'special-alloc' feature:
  the old code eat too much memory not to be adapted to new features added
  in release 2.4.0. This new implementation also bring some speed improvement

from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2
- fixing bug met when reading an archive in sequential-read mode
- fixing bug while filtering in sequential-read mode
- fixing backward compatibility in dar_manager with old archives (wrong dates
  for deleted files).
- fixing compilation problem on certain systems (missing #include statement)
- fixing documentation syntax and spelling

from 2.4.0 to 2.4.1
- adding information about "Cache Directory Tagging Standard" in doc/Feature.html
- fixing typo in doc/presentation.html
- fixing incomplete information in doc/usage_notes.html
- rewriting sample scripts from tcsh to bash in doc/usage_notes.html
- updating Swedish translation with the last version from Peter Landgren
  which has been forgotten for 2.4.0, sorry.
- fixing installation problem, where src/libdar/nls_swap.hpp was not installed
- fixing version returned by libdar_4_4::get_version to let kdar (or other
  external program relying on the backward compatible API) working as expected
- fixed bug in the code determining whether a directory is a subdirectory of
  another. This bug could lead dar to restore more files that just the one that
  were specified with -g option.
- added -k option to dar_manager for backward compatible behavior of dar_manager
- fixed bug in dar_manager, was recording the wrong date of EA removal (when
  an inode has dropped all its EA since the archive of reference was done).
- adapted dar_par_test.duc sample script to dar-2.4.x new behavior
- adapted libdar to MacOS X to restore mtime date after EA, as on this system,
  modifying some system specific EA implies updating the mtime. But dar cannot
  yet store and restore the "creation date", it needs specific MacOS X code,
  as this value is not available through Posix EA.
- fixed backward compatibility bug where dar 2.4.0 was not able to read archive
  containing only a catalogue (differential backup when no change occurred,
  snapshot backup, extracted catalogue) generated by dar 2.3.x or older.
- fixed self reported internal error met when dar is merging archives generated
  by dar 2.3.x versions.

from 2.3.x to 2.4.0
- hard links support for pipes, soft links, char and block devices has been
  added (so far, only hard links on plain files were supported)
- added rich overwriting feature for merging archives (-/ option)
- changed default behavior of dar: it no more tries to preserve the atime of
  read files, which had as side effect to modify the ctime. See man page for
  -aa and -ac options for details
- simplified the use of the "sed" command in Makefiles.am files
- integrated Wiebe Cazemier's patch for man page
- -E option has been extended to work also when generating a single sliced
  archive (no need to have -s option to be able to use -E option).
- slice header has been extended to store additional information (slice
  layout is now redundant in each each slice and may be used as backup from
  a slice to another in case of corruption).
- dar does no more need to read the first then the last slice of an archive to
  get its contents, it now instead only needs the last slice.
- an isolated catalogue can now be used as backup of the original archive's
  internal catalogue (-A option in conjunction with -x option for example)
- added directory look-up optimization (adaptation of Erik Wasser's patch)
- added -e option support (aka dry-run) to archive testing
- added the possibility to set permission and ownership of generated slices
- re-designed the libdar API to have all optional parameters carried by class
  object in a single argument, the aim to not break backward compatibility of
  the API upon each new feature addition. The libdar_4_4 namespace can be used
  for backward compatibility with older applications (see API documentation)
- added retry on change feature (-_ option).
- changed storage for UID and GID from U_16 to infinint to support arbitrarily
  larger UID and GID
- added lzo compression support
- dar_manager now uses an anonymous pipe to send configuration to dar, this
  solves the problem due to command-line limitation.
- dar now stores a "removal date" when a file disappeared since the archive of
  reference was done (so far only the information that a file was removed was
  stored). This is needed for dar_manager (see next new feature)
- dar_manager can now better restore the status of a set of files exactly as
  it was at any given time from a set of full and differential backups. In
  particular, it does no more restore files that were removed at the requested
  date.
- added check in dar_manager to detect conditions where a file has a
  modification date that has been set to the past. Two objectives are at the
  root of this feature: proper restoration of files and detection of possible
  rootkit
- added mode for restoration that avoid restoring directory tree which do not
  contain any saved files (in particular when restoring a differential backup)
  see man page for -D option for more details.
- reviewed implementation of code managing Extended Attributes (much faster now)
- added batch feature (-@ option) to dar_manager
- added Furtive Read Mode support (O_NOATIME + fdopendir): when the system
  supports it, while reading data, dar does not modify any date (ctime or atime)
- added the possibility to have sequential reading of archives (ala tar) see
  option --sequential-read
- added the possibility to read from a pipe (single pipe, without dar_slave)
  (use '-' as filename in conjunction with --sequential-read)
- added -P -g -[ and -] options to archive listing (-l option)
- added sparse file detection mechanism (can save and restore sparse files)
- added dirty flag in archive for file that changed while being saved. By
  default a warning is issued when the user is about to restore a dirty file,
  this can be changed thanks to the --dirty-behavior option
- -R option can receive an arbitrary string (still is excepted an empty string)
  In particular dar will no more complain if the given path contains // or \\
  however it must in a way or another point to something that exists!
- added a short listing feature (listing only the summary), (using both -l and
  -q options)
- extended conditional statements in included files (DCF) with user defined
  targets (see user target paragraph at the end of dar man page) User targets
  let the user add a set of options using a single keyword on command-line.
- a sample /etc/darrc is now proposed with some user targets for common
  operation like compression without compressing already compressed files.
- dar now releases filedescriptors of archive of reference(s) before proceeding
  to the operation (differential backup, archive isolation, etc.)
- user can add a comment in archive header some macro are provided for common
  options (see --user-comment in man page). This comment can be seen when
  listing an archive in verbose mode (-l -v) or when displaying the archive's
  summary (-l -v -q).
- added a "security warning" feature if ctime has changed in filesystem while
  inode has not changed at all (-asecu disables this feature). This is to target
  possible rootkit files. Note that this may toggle false positive, if for
  example you change EA of a file.
- added feature: DAR_DUC_PATH environment variable, which let dar look for a DUC
  file (see -E and -F options) in the given path.
- added feature: DAR_DCF_PATH environment variable, same as previously but for
  DCF files (see -B option).
- added two targets for conditional syntax: "reference:" and "auxiliary:"
- weak blowfish implementation has been removed (no backward compatibility as
  it suffered of a weak Initial Vector (IV) initialization), but the normal
  blowfish encryption stays in place.
- Due to openssh licensing, replaced openssh by libgcrypt dependancy (which
  stays optional).
- added new cyphers aes256, twofish256, serpent256 and camellia256
- added the hash feature (--hash option), supporting md5 and sha1 algorithms.
  The hash is calculated on the fly for each slice, before its data is even
  written to disk. This let one to check for media corruption even before a
  multi-sliced archive is finished. However this does not prevent an archive to
  be corrupted due to a software bug (in dar, libdar or in a external library),
  so it is always recommended to test the archive using dar's -t option.
- -G option (on-fly isolation) has been replaced by -@ when creating an archive,
  to reduce the number of letter used for options. This also let available the
  usual switches associated to -@ option to define an encryption algorithm and
  passphrase for the on-fly isolated catalogue.
- slices number may be padded with zeros (--min-digits option) Note that if using
  this option when creating an archive, this same option is required for any
  operation on this archive
- added -konly feature to only remove files recorded as suppressed at
  differential backup restoration time.
- dar and libdar now store keys in secure memory (with the exception that a DCF
  is parsed in unlocked memory, having a key in a DCF file is not as secure as
  having dar asking for password at execution time using the "-K :" syntax)
- added hook for backup: a user command or script can be run before saving and
  after backing up files that match a given mask all along the backup process
  (see -<, -> and -= options).
- added feature: -alist-ea let the user see the Extended Attributes of files
  while listing an archive contents.
- dar_manager can receive negative numbers to point to archive counting by the
  end of the database.
- dar and libdar stay released under GPL 2.1 (not under GPL 3, and not lesser
  GPL, neither)
- setting the "little/big endian" to usual meaning (it was inverted in the code)
  this does not change the dar's behavior nor its compatibility with different
  systems or older libdar versions.
- added -ai option to avoid warning for unknown inode types
- added support for Solaris's Door files
- added feature: decremental backup

from 2.3.11 to 2.3.12
- avoiding concurrent use of -p and -Q options, error message shown in that
  situation.

version 2.3.10 to 2.3.11
- fixed bug in the detection code of an existing archive of the same name when
  creating a new archive (improperly considered some files sharing a part of
  the archive basename as old slices of an archive of the same base name).
- fixed a display bug. When using -v to see which arguments get passed to dar
  by mean of configuration file (DCF file, ~/.darrc or /etc/darrc) the last
  argument found in file was not displayed.
- fixed two bugs (one in decompression routine, the other in decryption routine)
  that lead dar to segfault or run into an endless loop when reading a very
  corrupted archive.
- added -H option with -d option
- fixed bug leading Dar to report some files to be removed at restoration time
  to be of different type than the expected one when the reference used for
  that archive (difference backup) was an extracted catalogue.
- fixed bug in dar's command_line parsing leading dar to free twice the same
  block of memory when an argument containing a double slash was given to
  -G [SF 3162716].
- probable fix (problem difficult to reproduce) for double memory release in
  the storage class [SF 3163389]

version 2.3.9 to 2.3.10
- added patch by Jan-Pascal van Best to have -[ and -] options working with
  archive merging
- fixed bug in displaying dates [SF 2922417]
- enhanced pseudo random number generation used in dar
- added an error message when an include/exclude file listing does not
  contains an invalid path (instead of a self reported bug message).
- modified message displayed when some slice of an old archive having the
  same name are present in the destination directory (backup, isolation, merging,
  dar_xform)

from 2.3.8 to 2.3.9
- fixed bashism in doc/examples/pause_every_n_slice.duc sample script
   [SF 2020090]
- added Jason Lewis's script "dar_backups.sh" which is an enhanced version
  of n the script done by Roi Rodriguez Mendez & Mauro Silvosa Rivera.
- added message asking software upgrade to handle case when new archive format
  (used by dar >= 2.4.0) is provided to dar
- very little optimization of the reading process of EA
- updated FAQ
- replaced "Catalogue" by "Archive Contents" in output message (-l -v).
- added Sergey Feo's patch to dar_par.dcf
- added check against stddef.h header file presence in configure script
- fixed spelling
- added Charles's Script in doc/sample
- added -q option to dar
- added licensing exception to allow distribution of dar beside OpenSSL library
- Bug fix: during archive diff (only), dar restore atime of file in the backup
  instead of file in the system before opening it for reading.
- tested dar with valgrind

from 2.3.7 to 2.3.8
- fixed bug in libdar met when user supply an empty file as a list of file to
  include or exclude ( -[ and -] options )
- fixed bug concerning elastic buffers used beside strong encryption. No
  security issue here, just in some almost rare situations the generated archive
  was not readable (testing your archive prevents you loosing data in this
  situation)
- added some speed optimizations
- avoided warning to appear without -v option set, when an error is met while
  fetching value of nodump flag (flag not supported on filesystem for example).

from 2.3.6 to 2.3.7
- fixed bug in dar_manager about the localization of the archive in which to
  find the latest EA
- fixed bug in configure script to properly report full blowfish encryption
  support

  creation [SF #1800507]
- fixed problem with execvp when dar_manager launches dar

- integrated optimization patch from Sonni Norlov
- updated Swedish translation by Peter Landgren
- updated French translation
- fixed broken Native Language Support in 2.3.x (where x<5)

from 2.3.3 to 2.3.4
- fixed behavior when differential backup is interrupted (no more store file
  that would have been read if no interruption had been done as "deleted" since
  the archive of reference) [SF #1669091].
- added official method to access catalogue's statistics through the API (for
  kdar next version).
- Fixed syntax error in dar_par_create.duc and dar_par_test.duc files (Parchive
  integration with dar).

  encryption used [SF #1632273]
- added a check to verify that the libdar used is compatible with the current
  dar suite programs [SF #1587643]
- fixed bug: added workaround for the right arithmetic shift operator (the
  binary produced by gcc-3.4.2 produces computes "v>>s" equal to "v" when when
  v is a integer field composed of s exactly bits. It should rather compute it
  to zero...).
  this problem leads 32 bits generated archive incompatible with 64 bits
  generated archive only when blowfish is used.
- fixed bug met when the inode space is exhausted, thanks to "Jo - Ex-Bart" for
  this new feedback. [SF #1632738]
- replaced &, <, >, ' and " in XML listing by &...; corresponding sequence.
  [SF #1597403]

from 2.3.2 to 2.3.3
- avoid using getpwuid() and getgrgid() for static linking.
- fixed typo in dar's man page
- update FAQ

from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2
- fixed bug in Native Language Support when --enable-locale-dir was not set
  (Thomas Jacob's patch)
- updated Swedish translation by Peter Landgren
-  --verbose=skipped was not available (only the short -vs form was available)
- reviewed regex with ordered mask for the feature to better fits user's need

  Richard Fish's adequate patch)
- fixed tutorial with command line evolution (dar's -g option in particular)
- latest version of Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz's mini-howto
- fixed bug concerning restoration of only more recent files

from 2.3.0 to 2.3.1
- set back Nick Alcock's patch which has been dropped from 2.2.x to 2.3.x (patch
  name is "Do not moan about every single file on a non-ext2 filesystem")
- fixed compilation problem when thread-safe code is disabled
- integrated Wiebe Cazemier's patch for dar's man page
- fixed bug in listing: -as option also listed files that had EA even when these
  were not saved in the archive
- file permission of installed sample scripts lacked the executable bit
- fixed a bug that appeared when a file is removed while at the time it is saved
  by dar
- avoid having an unnecessary warning appearing when restoring a file in a
  directory that has default EA set
- Cygwin has changed and does not support anymore the path in the form
  "c:/some/where", you have to use "/cygdrive/c/some/where" instead.
  Documentation has been updated in consequence.

from 2.2.x to 2.3.0
- added user_interaction::pause2() method
- added the snapshot feature
- added the Cache Directory Tagging detection feature
- adapted Wesley's patch for a pkgconfig for libdar
- added -[ and -] options (file selection from file listing)
  Important consequence for libdar user programs:
  the fs_root argument is now expanded to full absolute path inside libdar,
  thus the mask you will give for path inclusion/exclusion (the "subtree"
  argument)will be used against full absolute path of files under consideration
  for the operation. Assuming you have fs_root=tmp/A and the current
  directory is /tmp, your mask will be used against strings like
  /var/tmp/A/some/file. (instead of tmp/A/some/file as in the previous API
  version). Things are equal if the fs_root is given an absolute path.
- changed archive format to "05". Due to complete review of EA management.
- upon some signal reception, dar aborts the backup nicely, producing a
  completely formatted archive will all the file saved so far. This archive can
  be take as reference for a further backup to continue the operation at a later
  time.
- dar_manager aborts properly upon certain signal reception (do not let the
  database partially updated).
- dar_slave and dar_xform now recognize when a slicename is given in place of a
  basename
- reviewed thread_cancellation (API change) for it be possible to cancel several
  thread at the same time
- prevent some dead-lock situation that can occur when a signal is received
  inside a critical section
- dar_cp, dar_xform and dar_slave also abort nicely upon signal reception
- dar_manager can now restore files based on a given date (not always the most
  recent version)
- dar_manager now has an interactive mode (-i option)
- change in API, the warning() method need not be overwritten, but the new
  protected method inherited_warning() must be inherited in its place (same
  function, same prototype as the original warning() method).
- dar_manager features are now part of libdar. API has been completed with these
  new features
- added the "last_slice" context (%c with -E option) when creating an archive
- dar now check a file has not been modified while it was reading it, if so it
  reports a warning and returns a specific exit code
- remove included gettext from the package (it is more a source of conflict with
  external gettext and if somebody needs internationalization better is to
  install libintl/gettext on its own).
- added George Foot feedback about the good backup practice sort guide.
- added -e option to dar_manager
- added the progressive_report feature in the API
- dar can now pause every N slice where N >= 1
- integrated Dave Vasilevsky's patch to support Extended Attributes and file
  forks under MacOS X
- added method in API for external program be able to list dar_manager
  databases, their file contents and the statistics
- added the merge/sub-archive feature
- remove [list of path] from command line (-g option is now mandatory)
- added regex expression in filters (-ar/-ag options)
- added -ak option
- added the --comparison-field option (extension of the --ignore-owner option
  aka -O option)
- added the -af option (backup files more recent than a given date, others are
  keept as already saved)
- dar now take care that an escape character can be sent when pressing the arrow
  keys and avoid considering them in this situation
- dar will no refuse to abort if user presses escape when dar asks the user to
  be ready to write to a new slice
- adapted Wesley Legette's patch for an xml archive listing
- added 'InRef' status for EA (same meaning as the one for file's data)

- fixed display problem in dar_cp that lead uncaught exception just before exiting

from 2.2.4 to 2.2.5
- limited size of internal buffers allocated on the stack to not
  be greater than SSIZE_MAX when this macro is defined. This comes
  from feedback from "Steffe" at sourceforge after he ported dar
  to HPnonStop.
- integrated Andrey Yasniy's patch: fixed differential backup problem with
  ru_RU.koi8-r locale.
- integrated  Nick Alcock's patch: no warning shown when not on EXT2
  filesystem and nodump feature has been activated.
- avoid having arrow key be interpreted as escape key (while they remains
  an escape key + one char, as received from the tty).
- added part of Kyler Klein's patch for OSX (Tiger) (only concerns included gettext)

from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4
- fixed #35
- added in doc/samples the backup Script of Rodriguez Mendez & Mauro Silvosa
  Rivera
- updated Swedish translation by Peter Landgren

- error in TUTORIAL (-P only receives relative paths)
- updated FAQ with memory requirement questions/problem
- added Bob Barry's script for determining memory requirement
- added documentation about NLS in doc/NOTES
- fixed bug concerning the << operator of infinint class. This has no
  impact as this operator is not used in dar/libdar.
- added Jakub Holy's script to doc/samples
- fixed bug with patch transmitted from Debian (Brian May) about the
  detection of the ext2_fs.h header.
- added warning in libdar when user asks the nodump flags to be checked against
  while the nodump feature has not been activated at compilation time.
- fixed dar man page about --gzip option usage when using an argument
- now counting as errors the file with too long filename
- now counting the file excluded due to nodump flag as ignored due filter
  selection

from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
- fixed typo in dar man page (flowfish ;-) )
- -Q option now forces the non terminal mode even when dar is run from a
  terminal (tty) this makes dar possible to run in background without having
  the shell stopping it upon text output.
- removed unused control code for dar's command line syntax
- spelling fix of the tutorial by Ralph Slooten
- added the pertinent part of the memory leak patch from Wesley Leggette
  (there is no bug here as the function where could occur the memory leak
   is not used in dar (!) ).

  like -z9 or --zip 9
- avoid calls to textdomain() when --disable-nls is set
- updates doc/NOTES

  corresponding a "delete" in place of a "delete[]" (Wesley's patch))
  In consequences, for API users, note that the following calls
	  - tools_str2charptr
  	  - tools_extract_basename
	  - libdar_str2charptr_noexcept
  all return a char * pointer which area must be released
  by the caller using the delete[] operator

  (the parent copy constructor is not called from inherited copy
   constructor; note that the parent class is a pure virtual class)

- fixed typo in French translation
- added a const_cast statment to avoid compilation warning under some systems
- fixed problem on solaris where the TIME&MIN non canonical parameters
  for terminal are not set by default to 1 and 0 (but to 4 and 0),
  leading keyboard interaction to be impossible when dar needs
  user interaction.
- added O_BINARY to open() mode in dar_cp, without this will cause some problem
  under Cygwin.

  argument which is compression level to use.
- I and -X now available while listing archive contents (-l)
- based on Brian May's patch, dar with EA_SUPPORT avoids complaining when
  reading a filesystem that do not supports EA.
- based on Brian May's other patch, dar now uses by default the <stdint.h>
  integers.
- dar is now built with dynamic linking, and a special version named
  dar_static which is statically linked is also available

  /usr/local/share/doc by default. (Thanks to Jerome Zago)
  (conform to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)
- added scrambling features (-J and -K options)
- added selective compression (-Y and -Z options)
- added third state for saved data to keep trace in an extracted catalogue of
  what is saved in the reference archive (this opens the door to the archive
  manager)
- added the ability to read configuration file (-B option, -B like "batch").
- if a slice name is given in place of a base name, dar proposes to change
  to the correct base name (strips the extension number and dots).
- fixed bug #8
- added dar_manager command-line program
- replaced integer types by macro that can be adapted to have correct behavior
  on 64 bits platform (in particular to read archive from other platforms).

from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0
- added feature: now ignored directory are not stored at all in the archive
      unless -D option is used, in which case ignored directory are recorded as
      empty directory (as it was in 1.0.x)

- fixed bug #2
- fixed bug #3
- added feature: restore only more recent file than existing one (-r option)
- added feature: support for Extended Attributes (activated at compilation)
- added feature: verbose option (-v) with -l (add archive contents)
- modified behavior: -l option without -v is no more interactive
- added feature: archive integrity test (option -t). CRC have been added in
      the archive (format 02), thus even without compression Dar is able to
      detect errors.
- added feature: comparison with filesystem (difference) (option -d)
- modified behavior: non interactive messages goes to stdout, while those
      asking user, goes to stderr (all goes to stderr if stdout is used for
      producing the archive, or for sending orders do dar_slave.
- added feature: DAR automatically goes in non interactive mode if no terminal
      is found on standard input (for example when run from crontab). In that
      case any question make DAR to abort.
- added feature: catalogue extraction to small file: "isolation" (-C option)
- added feature: archive produced on stdout when using -c or -C with "-" as
      filename
- added feature: -V option summarizes version of the binary
- added feature: additional command "dar_xform" to "re-slice" an archive
- added feature: read archive trough a pair of pipes with the help of dar_slave
- added feature: long option are now available (see man page)
- fixed bug #5

- dar returns an new error code when an operation is partially successful
  (some filed missed to be saved / restored / tested / compared).
- replace the use of vform() method by a customized simple implementation
  in the ui_printf() routine, this should now allow compilation with gcc-3
- changed long option that used an underscore character (`_') by a dash ('-')
- added -O option to have a better behavior when used with non root user
- added 'make doc' option in the makefile
