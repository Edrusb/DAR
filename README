PRESENTATION
================

dar is a shell command, that makes backup of a directory tree and files. 
Actually it has been tested only under Linux, but future issue is planed 
for windows. A GUI for Linux will also follow, for version 2.0.0

FEATURES
================

FILTERS :
dar is able to backup from total file system to a single file. Additionally a 
mechanism of filters permits, based on the filename, to exclude or include 
some files while backing up or restoring a directory tree. In the other
side, a secondary filter mechanism permits to exclude some branches of a 
directory tree, or to only include some branches.

DIFFERENTIAL BACKUP :
When making a backup with dar, you have the possibility to make a full backup
or a differential backup. A full backup, as expected makes backup of all
files as specified on the command line (with or without filters). Instead, a
differential backup, (over filter mechanism), saves only files that have 
changed since a given reference backup. Additionally, files that existed in 
the reference backup and which do no more exist at the time of the 
differential backup are recorded in the backup. At recovery time, (unless you
deactivate it), restoring a differential backup will update changed files
and new files, but also remove files that have been recorded as deleted. 
Note that the reference backup can be a full backup or another differential
backup. This way you can make a first full backup, then many differential 
backup, each taking as reference the last backup made.

SLICES :
Dar stands for Disk ARchive. From the beginning it was designed to be able
to split an archive over several removable media whatever their number is
and whatever their size is. Thus dar is able to save over old floppy disk,
CD-R, DVD-R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, Zip, Jazz, etc... Dar is not concerned by 
un/mounting a removable medium, instead it is independent of hardware. 
Given the size, it will split the archive in several files (called SLICES),
eventually pausing before creating the next one, allowing this way, the user
to un/mount a medium, burn the file on CD-R, send it by email (if your mail
system does not allow huge file in emails, dar can help you here also).
By default, (no size specified), dar will make one slice whatever its size is.
Additionally, the size of the first slice can be specified separately, if for
example you want first to fulfil an partially filled disk before starting
using empty ones. Last, at restoration time, dar will just pause and prompt 
the user asking a slice only if it is missing.

COMPRESSION :
last, dar can use compression. By default no compression is used. Actually 
only gzip algorithm is implemented, but some room has been done for bzip2 and
any other compression algorithm. Note that, compression is made before slices,
which means that using compression with slices, will not make slices smaller, 
but will probably make less slices in the backup.


DIRECT ACCESS :
even using compression dar has not to read the whole backup to extract one 
file. This way if you just want to restore one file from a huge backup, the 
process will be much faster than using tar. Dar first reads the catalogue 
(i.e. the contents of the backup), then it goes directly to the location of
the saved file(s) you want to restore and proceed to restoration. In 
particular using slices dar will ask only for the slice(s) containing the
file(s) to restore.


LIMITATIONS :
==============
dar does not restore hard linked files correctly. But, no data loss will
occur just data duplication, but instead of two directory entries pointing 
to the same file content, dar will restore two directories pointing on two 
copies of the original file.

The size of SLICES may be limited by the file system (ext2 maximum file size
is 4 GByte), the number of SLICES is only limited by the size of the filenames,
thus using a base name of 10 chars, considering your file system can support
256 char per filename at most, you could already get up to  10^241 SLICES,
1 followed by 241 zero. As soon as your file system will support bigger files
or longer filename, dar will follow without change.
