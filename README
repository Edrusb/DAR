PRESENTATION
================
dar is a shell command, that makes backup of a directory tree and files.
It has been tested under Linux, Windows (95, 2000, NT, XP, 7), OpenSolaris,
FreeBSD and NetBSD, and has been reported as working under Mac OS X 10.3
(where it takes care of file forks but not of the ACL).

External GUI are possible and exist thanks to the libdar library and its API,
which is contained in within this source package.

        dar
        dar_xform
        dar_slave
        dar_manager
        dar_static (statically linked version of dar, not all system
	            support static linking)
        dar_cp
