PRESENTATION
================
dar is a shell command, that makes backup of a directory tree and files.
It has been tested under Linux, Windows (95, 2000, NT, XP) and Solaris 8.
External GUI are possible thanks to the libdar library and its API.

Actually dar is a set of six commands:
        dar
        dar_xform
        dar_slave
        dar_manager
        dar_static (statically linked version of dar, it does not exist for
                    Cygwin nor Solaris)
        dar_cp

And since version 2.0.0 theses commands are based on a library called
libdar. This library is part of dar and licensed under the Gnu General
Public License (GPL in the following) as all the source code of the Dar
suite programs. This imply that you can link libdar to your programs at
the condition that your programs are also covered by the GPL, which says
in particular that you must provide source code of your program. See
COPYING file for details.

To use the libdar library an API has been defined. See doc/DOC_API
