PRESENTATION
================

dar is a shell command, that makes backup of a directory tree and files. 
Actually it has been tested only under Linux, but future issue is planed 
for windows. A GUI for Linux will also follow, for version 2.0.0

FEATURES
================


FILTERS:
dar is able to backup from total file system to a single file. Additionally a 
mechanism of filters permits, based on the filename, to exclude or include 
some files while backing up or restoring a directory tree. In the other
side, a secondary filter mechanism permits to exclude some branches of a 
directory tree, or to only include some branches.


DIFFERENTIAL BACKUP:
When making a backup with dar, you have the possibility to make a full backup
or a differential backup. A full backup, as expected makes backup of all
files as specified on the command line (with or without filters). Instead, a
differential backup, (over filter mechanism), saves only files that have 
changed since a given reference backup. Additionally, files that existed in 
the reference backup and which do no more exist at the time of the 
differential backup are recorded in the backup. At recovery time, (unless you
deactivate it), restoring a differential backup will update changed files
and new files, but also remove files that have been recorded as deleted. 
Note that the reference backup can be a full backup or another differential
backup. This way you can make a first full backup, then many differential 
backup, each taking as reference the last backup made.


SLICES:
Dar stands for Disk ARchive. From the beginning it was designed to be able
to split an archive over several removable media whatever their number is
and whatever their size is. Thus dar is able to save over old floppy disk,
CD-R, DVD-R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, Zip, Jazz, etc... Dar is not concerned by 
un/mounting a removable medium, instead it is independent of hardware. 
Given the size, it will split the archive in several files (called SLICES),
eventually pausing before creating the next one, allowing this way, the user
to un/mount a medium, burn the file on CD-R, send it by email (if your mail
system does not allow huge file in emails, dar can help you here also).
By default, (no size specified), dar will make one slice whatever its size is.
Additionally, the size of the first slice can be specified separately, if for
example you want first to fulfil a partially filled disk before starting
using empty ones. Last, at restoration time, dar will just pause and prompt 
the user asking a slice only if it is missing.


COMPRESSION:
last, dar can use compression. By default no compression is used. Actually 
only gzip algorithm is implemented, but some room has been done for bzip2 and
any other compression algorithm. Note that, compression is made before slices,
which means that using compression with slices, will not make slices smaller, 
but will probably make less slices in the backup.


DIRECT ACCESS:
even using compression dar has not to read the whole backup to extract one 
file. This way if you just want to restore one file from a huge backup, the 
process will be much faster than using tar. Dar first reads the catalogue 
(i.e. the contents of the backup), then it goes directly to the location of
the saved file(s) you want to restore and proceed to restoration. In 
particular using slices dar will ask only for the slice(s) containing the
file(s) to restore.


HARD LINK CONSIDERATION:
hard links are now properly saved. They are properly restored if possible. If 
for example restoring across a mounted filesystem, hard linking will fail, but
dar will then duplicate the inode and file content, issuing a warning.


EXTENDED ATTRIBUTES:
support for extended attributes have to be activated at compilation time 
(see INSTALL). Dar is able to save and restore EA, all or just those of a
given namespace (system or user). If no EA have been saved and restoration
occurs over a file that has EA, they will be preserved. But if they have 
been saved empty for a given file, any existing EA for that file will be 
removed at restoration time, unless -u and/or -U is given on command-line.


ARCHIVE TESTING
thanks to CRC (cyclic redundancy checks), dar is able to detect data corruption
in the archive. Only the file where data corruption occurred will not be 
possible to restore, but dar will restore the other even when compression is 
used.


USING PIPES
dar is now able to produce an archive to its standard output or named pipe. it
is also able to read an archive through a pair of pipes, to take a remote 
archive as reference, or even to restore data from a remote archive. This way 
it is now possible to store an archive remotely and in total security (if using
encrypted means)


ISOLATION
the catalogue (i.e.: the contents of an archive), can be extracted (this 
operation is called isolation) to a small file, that can in turn be used
as reference for differential archive. There is no more need to provide an 
archive to be able to create a differential backup over it, just its
catalogue is necessary.


RE-SHAPE SLICES OF AN EXISTING ARCHIVE
the external program named "dar_xform" is able to change the size of slices
of a given archive. The resulting archive is totally identical to archives
directly created by dar. Source archive can be taken from a set of slice, 
from standard input or even a named pipe.


LIMITATIONS :
==============
The size of SLICES may be limited by the file system or kernel (maximum
file size is 2 GByte with Linux kernel 2.2.x), the number of SLICES is 
only limited by the size of the filenames, thus using a base name of 10 
chars, considering your file system can support 256 char per filename at 
most, you could already get up to  10^241 SLICES, 1 followed by 241 zero. 
But as soon as your file system will support bigger files or longer filename, 
dar will follow without change.
