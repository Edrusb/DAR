	SUMMARY


This document tells you how to compile and install from sources for Linux,
and Windows (using Cygwin). For RPM packages, install as any other package 
(see rpm man page and documentation). A note is given at the end for the 
somehow experimental binary package for Windows.



	REQUIREMENTS

You need a c++ compiler (source tested with gcc)
and zlib must be installed (at least version 1.1.3, but 1.1.4 is recommended).



	INSTALLATION FOR LINUX

1. First edit the Makefile to suite your needs 
      * change INSTALL_ROOT_DIR 
	if you don't want to install dar binary in /usr/local/bin
	man pages in /usr/local/man
	and documentations in /usr/local/doc/dar-<version>
      * uncomment EA_SUPPORT if your platform supports extended attributes
      * uncomment FILEOFFSET if you need support for large files
      * comment out USE_SYS_SIGLIST if you are going to compile under Cygwin
      * uncomment the "OS_BITS = 64" if you are compiling for alpha (64 bits)
      * if you need a special compiler set CXX and CC accordingly
    NOTE that there will be one day a "configure" script, which will simplify
    this setup step 1, I hope. ;-)

2. you will need to compile it:

	make

3. As root install it with
	
	make install

(This will install the dar suite binaries as well as their manual page).

4. and if you want documentation installed
	
	make install-doc

(This will install TUTORIAL, README, NOTES, etc.)

Optionally:
-----------

To uninstall: (also uninstalls doc if it was installed)

	make uninstall

To clean the package source tree after compilation:
	
	make clean

If you want to debug dar's "infinint" integers or just get all factorial digits
of a given number use the factoriel program:

first compile it:

	make factoriel

Then to use factoriel:

	./factoriel 100

	The argument is a decimal number as huge as you want, all 
	depends on the time you want to spend to compute the decimal 
	representation of the factorial ("n!" in math).

If you have planed to debug, you can build the several test programs 
aimed to quite each module. They are to be used with a debugger for 
step by step execution, not as fail/pass tests. Moreover some of them might now
be obsolete:

	make test




	INSTALLATION FOR WINDOWS FROM SOURCES


the compilation requires Cygwin ( http://cygwin.com/ ) 
"Cygwin is a UNIX environment, developed by Red Hat, for Windows"
you need from Cygwin the "gcc", "make" and "zlib" packages at least. If you
need to edit the Makefile, install a text editor (such as vi or vim).
Then, all steps described above for Linux apply here.



	INSTALLATION FOR WINDOWS FROM BINARY PACKAGE

the binary package is a *.tgz file (thus you need winzip to unpack it). 
It contains a subdirectory (named dar) you will have to extract where you
want in your directory tree.  
Optionally you can add the path to dar in the PATH variable in autoexec.bat.
Considering dar has been extracted under C:\dar you can add the following line
in autoexec.bat:

	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Dar

then you have to reboot 
(This is just to respect the Windows usage and way of life ;-) )

Else if you don't setup the PATH variable, you need to specify the full 
path to dar executables to use them from the Windows command-line prompt.

Note that path given to dar suite's program must respect the UNIX way (use
slashes "/" not back slashes "\") the root path "/" is C:\Cygwin. Thus this
directory must exist. This binary for Windows is more or less experimental for
what concern the interaction with the system through Cygwin (I don't see how
dar can access to floppy of other disks ... any suggestions, or tricks are
welcome for feedback ! :-)
