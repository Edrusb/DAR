        SUMMARY
        =======

                 I   _ installation from RPM binary package
                 II  _ installation from sources
                 III _ installation from binary package for windows


        I _ INSTALLATION FROM RPM
        ==========================

For RPM packages, install as any other package (see rpm man page and
relative documentation).


        II _ INSTALLATION FROM SOURCES
        ==============================

        REQUIREMENTS

You need to have installed:
- c++ compiler (supported compiler range from gcc-2.95.3 to gcc-3.3.1)
- zlib must be installed (at least version 1.1.3, but 1.1.4 is recommended),
  see http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ for source code,
- as well as libbzip2 (tested with version 1.0.2, more recent should also work)
  see http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/ for source code.


1. configure the package using the configuration script:

        ./configure [options...]


check the doc/configure_options document to have the list of options and
which are supported on which system.


2. then you need to compile:

        make

IMPORTANT. if you get compilation error at this step, try setting CXXFLAGS
to -O (the letter O not zero) and return to step 1 (configure):

	CXXFLAGS=-O
	export CXXFLAGS
	make clean distclean
	./configure [options...]
	make

or if you use a cshell:
	setenv CXXFLAGS -O
	make clean distclean
	./configure [options...]
	make

the problem may come from compiler or system header files.

3. As root install it with:

        make install-strip

This will install the dar suite binaries, libdar library and include files
as well as their manual page, sample programs, if built, are never installed.
'make install' also works but makes bigger binaries as they keep their symbol
table, which is not useful for normal operations.



        III _ INSTALLATION FOR WINDOWS FROM BINARY PACKAGE
        ==================================================


the binary package is a *.zip file (thus you need winzip to unpack it).
It contains a subdirectory (named dar) you will have to extract where you
want in your directory tree.
Optionally you can add the path to dar in the PATH variable in autoexec.bat.
Considering dar has been extracted under C:\dar you can add the following line
in autoexec.bat:

        set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Dar

then you have to reboot.
(Just kidding ! This was to respect the Windows usage and way of life ;-) )

Else if you don't setup the PATH variable, you need to specify the full
path to dar executables to use them from the Windows command-line prompt.


        IMPORTANT NOTE !

Note that path given to dar suite's program must respect the UNIX way (use
slashes "/" not back slashes "\") thus you have to have to use c:/temp in
place of c:\temp for example.

example:

        c:\dar_win-1.2.1\dar -c f:/tmp/toto -s 2G -z1 -R "c:/My Documents"

          ^             ^         ^   ^                     ^
          |             |         |   |                     |
          ---------------         ---------------------------
        here use anti-slash         but here we use slash
        as usually under           in arguments given to dar
        windows to point
        the command
