REQUIREMENTS (only if you plan to compile)
================
you need a c++ compiler (source tested with gcc-2.91.66)
zlib must be installed (at least version 1.1.3)



INSTALLATION 
================

1. first edit the Makefile to suite your needs 
	you should only have to change 
	INSTALL_ROOT_DIR 
	if you don't want to install dar binary in /usr/local/bin
	and a man page in /usr/local/man

2. if you don't have pre-built binaries, compile dar with :

	make

3. as root install it with :
	
	make install
(it will install the dar binary as well its manual page)


Optionally :
----------------

to uninstall :

	make uninstall

to clean the package source tree after :
	
	make clean

if you want to debug or to play with the factoriel program (which is a little software used for testing the infini-integer used in dar),  

	make factoriel

to use factoriel :

	./factoriel 100
	the argument is a decimal number as huge as you want, all depends on the time want to
	spend to compute the decimal representation of the factoriel ( "n!" in math. ).

if you've planed to debug, you can build the several test program aimed to quite each module

	make test


have fun !
