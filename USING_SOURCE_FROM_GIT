	HOWTO USE SOURCE CODE FOUND IN GIT

In GIT you will only find source code, and no generated files. The configure
script for example is generated from configure.ac file with autoconf tool,
so you will not find it here an need specific tools to build this kind of files
that are usually included in released packages.

WARNING 1:
You must be aware of the GIT tree structure, if not, you will probably have
obtained the latest development version. Development version of dar is nothing
more nothing less than development! It may work or may not and may be in a
transition state. Do NOT USE DEVELOPMENT VERSION TO BACKUP YOUR SYSTEM!!!

WARNING 2:
No support will be provided for development source. DO NOT REPORT BUG about any
problem met with development version of dar, but rather participate to the
pre-release phases. DO NOT ASK FOR SUPPORT about a development version,
but rather preserve the developpers from doing anything else than development,
this will make development going faster and avoid them loosing precious time.

ACKNOLEDGMENT:
If you have read dar's documentation about the way GIT is used, and have
retrieved the latest version of a particular branch (not the `master' branch),
you are welcome to use this version for your own backup, ask for support in the
dar-support mailing-list (precising the way you got the source code). If you
find a problem with the latest release, and can still reproduce it with the
version of that branch, you are welcome to open a bug report. If the problem
is new to that GIT version, please ask for support on dar-support mailing-list.


COMPILATION IN BRIEF:

For a small program, you usually get a single source file to compile. But, when
the program gets bigger, there is usually several files to compile and link
together to obtain an executable binary. As this operation is not that evident
and needs some understanding of the program implementation, usually the
developpers provide a Makefile that let the building much more easy (just type
'make' and the things goes on).

Here dar is not a small program, it uses several Makefiles, and overall it must
be able to work under Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, MacOS X, Cygwin, and many other
operating systems. Thus a single type of Makefile will not work because system
include files, system library to link with do vary from system to system. For
that reason, automake, autoconf, libtool and gettext are used to generate the
correct Makefiles for the current system. These Makefiles, and the configure
script are usually provided in each released package, but here as they are
generated from other configuration file (Makefile.am and configure.ac), you
will have to generate these files yourself.

For that reason, you need the following tools:
- gnu M4  ( http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/ )
- autoconf ( http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ )
- automake ( http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/ )
- libtool ( http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ )
- gettext ( ohttp://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html )

If they are not present on your system, you must first install them.
You can then use the following demo script (it may work or not on
you system, that's more to be considered as a reminder of the different
steps to follow to build the configure script and Makefiles):

	misc/init

Then you are ready to build dar as detailed in the documentation, in brief,
the following commands should correspond to most needs:

	./configure
	make
	make install-strip

For your information the following diagram may help you. Be aware that this
is a bit simplified.
