from version 1.0.0 to version 1.0.1 
- correction of few mistakes that lead the compilation to fail with certain 
      C++ compilers
- bug #1 fixed.

from version 1.0.1 to version 1.0.2
- bug #2 fixed
- bug #3 fixed

from version 1.0.2 to version 1.0.3
- bug #5 fixed

from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0
- added feature: now ignored directory are not stored at all in the archive
      unless -D option is used, in which case ignored directory are recorded as
      empty dir (as it was in 1.0.x)
- added support for hard links. Generated archive format version is now 02, but
      format 01 can still be read, and use as reference.
- fixed bug #1
- fixed bug #2
- fixed bug #3
- added feature: restore only more recent file than existing one (-r option)
- added feature: support for Extended Attributes (activated at compilation)
- added feature: verbose option (-v) with -l (add archive contents)
- modified behaviour: -l option without -v is no more interactive
- added feature: archive integrity test (option -t). CRC have been added in
      the archive (format 02), thus even without compression Dar is able to 
      detect errors.
- added feature: comparison with filesystem (difference) (option -d)
- modified behaviour: non interactive messages goes to stdout, while those
      asking user, goes to stderr (all goes to stderr if stdout is used for
      producing the archive, or for sending orders do dar_slave.
- added feature: DAR automatically goes in non interactive mode if no terminal
      is found on standart input (for example when run from crontab). In that
      case any question make DAR to abort.
- added feature: catalogue extraction to small file: "isolation" (-C option)
- added feature: archive produced on stdout when using -c or -C with "-" as 
      filename
- added feature: -V option summarises version of the binary
- added feature: additional command "dar_xform" to "re-slice" an archive
- added feature: read archive trough a pair of pipes with the help of dar_slave
- added feature: long option are now available (see man page)
- fixed bug #5
- a lot of speed optimisation in algorithm
- changed exit codes to positive values in case of error
- dar returns an new error code when an operation is partially successful 
  (some filed missed to be saved / restored / tested / compared).
- replace the use of vform() method by a customised simple implementation 
  in the ui_printf() routine, this should now allow compilation with gcc-3
- changed long option that used an underscore character (`_') by a dash ('-')
- added -O option to have a better behaviour when used with non root user
- added 'make doc' option in the makefile
