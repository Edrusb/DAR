# This is the default system wide configuration file for dar
#

# It is used automatically by dar unless you define a .darrc in
# your home directory or use -N option on command-line.
# You can continue using this default file even if you use your
# own .darrc file, by including the following in it:
#
#     -B /etc/darrc
#

# To not force anyone to use a given option, each option set
# is defined under a specific user target. Each user target can
# be used on command-line to activate the set of option it defines.
# For example, using the word "par2" on command-line will activate
# all options following the "par2:" keyword below.

# we are using short options here because long options may not be
# available everywhere.

par2:
  -B "SOMEPATH/dar_par.dcf"

compress-exclusion:
# here we define some files that have not to be compressed.
# First setting case insentive mode on:
-an
# Then telling dar that the following masks are glob expression
# which is the default, right, but if sooner on command-line the
# user swapped to regex, the following mask would not work as expected
# any more, so we force back to glob expression in any case:
-ag

# Now follows all the file specification to never try to compress:

# compressed video format
-Z "*.mpg"
-Z "*.avi"
-Z "*.flac"
-Z "*.cr2"
-Z "*.vob"

# compressed picture format
-Z "*.jpg"
-Z "*.jpeg"
-Z "*.mpeg"
-Z "*.png"

# compressed audio format
-Z "*.mp3"
-Z "*.ogg"

# compressed package
-Z "*.deb"
-Z "*.tgz"
-Z "*.tbz2"
-Z "*.rpm"
-Z "*.xpi"
-Z "*.run"
-Z "*.sis"

# other compressed data
-Z "*.gz"
-Z "*.Z"
-Z "*.bz2"
-Z "*.zip"
-Z "*.jar"
-Z "*.rar"

# dar archives (may be compressed)
-Z "*.dar"

# Now we swap back to case sensitive mode for masks which is the default
# mode:
-acase


verbose:
-v
-vs

no-emacs-backup:
-ag
-X "*~"
-X ".*~"

samba:
-H 1
# samba filesystem need this to properly report date
# and not lead dar to resave all files when changing
# from summer to winter time and viceversa.


dry-run:
-e
# well, the name of the option is not intuitive, I admit,
# but letter d was already used ...

bell:
-b
