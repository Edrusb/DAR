    <h2><a name="packages_signature">Packages Signature</a></h2>
    <p>
      Source packages and binary
      packages for windows are signed with
      <a href="authentification.html">author's GPG key</a>.
      You can find the signatures for
      released packages on the
      <a href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/sign">home page</a>
      and on its <a href="http://dar.sourceforge.net/sign">mirror site</a>.
      Binary packages for your distro have to be fetched from your distro's
      site which will probably provide you electronic signatures.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="source_download">Source Packages</a></h2>
    <p>
      Source packages can be found
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=65612">on sourceforge</a>,
      if you don't trust sourceforge check the package GPG signatures as described above.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="linux_binaries">Binary packages for Linux</a></h2>
    <p>
      Most Linux distribution do provide a binary package for dar/libdar. In fact,
      the dar source package is most of the time split into tree or more
      packages, one for libdar library, a second for the dar command-line
      tools and a third for the dar documentation.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="windows_binaries">Binary package for Windows</a></h2>
    <p>
      Binary packages for windows are provided
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=65612">on sourceforge</a>.
      There is several points to be aware of when <a name="dar_under_windows"></a>using
      dar under windows:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt class=void>IMPORTANT NOTES</dt><dd>
	<p>
	  The paths given to dar's arguments and options
	  must respect the UNIX way (use slashes "/" not back
	  slashes "\" as it ought to be under Windows)
	  thus for example you have to have to use <code>/temp</code>
	  in place of <code>\temp</code>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Moreover, drive letters cannot be used the usual way, like
	  <code><e>c:\</e>windows\system32</code>. Instead you will have to
	  give the following path <code><e>/cygdrive/c/</e>windows/system32</code>.
	  As you see the <code>/cygdrive</code> directory is a
	  virtual directory that has all the drives as children directories:
	</p>
	<p>
	  Here is a more global example:
	</p>
	<code class=block>
	  &nbsp;c:\dar_win-1.2.1\dar -c /cygdrive/f/tmp/toto -s 2G -z1 -R "/cygdrive/c/My Documents"
	  &nbsp;
	  &nbsp;  ^             ^         ^   ^                     ^
	  &nbsp;  |             |         |   |                     |
	  &nbsp;  ---------------         ---------------------------
	  &nbsp; here use anti-slash        but here we use slash
	  &nbsp; as usually under           in arguments given to dar
	  &nbsp; windows to point
	  &nbsp; the command
	</code>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      When running <i>dar</i> from a windows command-line (thus not from cygwin environement), dar's root directory
      is the parent directory of the one holding the <i>dar.exe</i> file. This does not mean that you cannot have dar
      backing up anything outside this directory (you can thanks to the <code>/cygdrive/...</code> path alias seen above),
      but when dar looks for <code>darrc</code> it looks using this parent directory as the "/" root one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since release 2.6.14, the published dar packages for Windows are configured and built
      in such a way that <i>dar.exe</i> uses the provided <code>darrc</code> file located in the <code>etc</code>
      sub-directory. So <code>darrc</code> is now usable, out of the box.
      However if you rename the directory where <i>dar.exe</i> is located, which name is something like
      <code>dar64-x.y.z-win64</code>, the <i>dar.exe</i> binary will still look for a <code>darrc</code> at
      <code>/dar64-x.y.z-win64/etc/darrc</code>, taking as root directory the parent directory
      of the directory where it resides.
