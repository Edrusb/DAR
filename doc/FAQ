ANSWERS
--------

A1 - When restoring/saving, all files are considered by default. But if you specify some files to restore or save, all other files are "ignored", this is the case when using -P -X -I or -g.

A2 - Dar can produce archive on its standard output, if you give '-' as basename. But it cannot read an archive from its standard input. To feed an archive to dar through pipes, you need dar_slave and two pipes. The first pipe transmits orders from dar to dar_slave that tell dar_slave the requested portion of the archive, the second pipe goes the other way and carries from dar_slave the data requested by dar. This way, only needed data get transmitted over pipes, which cannot be possible with a single pipe.

A3 - if you restore for example the file usr/bin/emacs dar will first restore usr (if the directory already exists, it will get its date and ownership restored, all existing files will be preserved), the /usr/bin is restored, then usr/bin/emacs is restored. Thus 3 inodes have been restored or modified while only one file has been asked for restoration.

A4 - For any binary package, ask your distro maintainer to include dar (if not already done), and check on the web site of your preferite distro for a dar package.
