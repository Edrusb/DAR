      <h2>Answers:</h2>
      <a name="A1"><b>I restore/save all files but dar reported some files have been ignored, what are those ignored files?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	When restoring/saving, all files are considered by default. But if you specify some files to restore or
	save, all other files are "ignored", this is the case when using -P -X
	-I, -g -[ or -] options
      </p>

      <a name="A2" id="A2"><b>Dar hangs when using it with pipes, why?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Dar can produce backups on its
	standard output, if you give '-' as
	basename. But it cannot read a backup from its standard input in
	direct access mode. To
	feed a backup to dar through pipes, you either need <code>dar_slave</code> and two pipes
	or use the sequential mode (<code>--sequential-mode</code> option, which gives
	slow restoration of a few files compared to the (default) direct access mode).
	To use dar with dar_slave over pipes in direct access mode (which is
	the&nbsp; more efficient way to proceed), see the <a href="usage_notes.html#dar_remote">detailed notes</a> or more
	precisely <a href="usage_notes.html#netcat_ssh">dar and ssh note</a>.
      </p>

      <a name="A3" id="A3"><b>Why, when I restore 1 file, dar report 3 files have been restored?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	if you restore for example the file usr/bin/emacs dar will first
	restore usr (if the directory already exists, it will get its date and
	ownership restored, all existing files in that directory will however stay
	preserved), then
	/usr/bin will be restored, and last usr/bin/emacs will be restored.
	Thus 3 inodes have been
	restored or modified while only one file has been asked for restoration.
      </p>
      <a name="libattr"><b>While compiling dar I get the following message: <code>g++: /lib/libattr.a: No such file or directory</code>, what can I do?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	The problem comes from an
	incoherence in your distro (Redhat and Slackware seem(ed) concerned at
	least): Dar (Libtool) finds
	<code>/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.3.3/../../../libattr.la</code>
	file to link with. This file defines where is located libattr static and
	dynamic libraries but in this file both static and dynamic libraries
	are expected to be found under /lib. While the dynamic libattr is
	there, the static version has been moved to /usr/lib. A
	workaround is to make a symbolic link:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	ln -s /usr/lib/libattr.a /lib/libattr.a
      </code>
      <br/>

      <a name="A4" id="A4"><b>I cannot find the binary package for my distro, where to look for?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	For any
	binary package, ask
	your distro maintainer to include dar (if
	not already done), and check on the web site of your preferred distro
	for a dar package
      </p>

      <a name="A6" id="A6"><b>Can I use different filters between a full backup and a
	  differential backup? Would not dar consider some file not included in
	  the filter to be deleted?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Yes, you
	can. No, there is no
	risk to have dar deleting the files that
	were not selected for the differential backup. Here is the way dar
	works:
      </p>

      <p>During a
	backup process, when a
	file is ignored due to filter
	exclusion, an "ignored" entry is added to the catalogue. At the
	end of the backup, dar compares both catalogues, the one of reference
	and the new one built during the backup process, and adds a "detruit" entry
	(which means "destroyed" in French), when an entry of the reference is not
	present in the new catalogue. Thus, if an "ignored" is present no
	"detruit" will be added for that name. Then all "ignored" entries are
	removed and the catalogue is written at the end of the backup or archive.
      </p>

      <a name="A7" id="A7"><b>Once in action, dar makes all the system slower and slower, then it stops with the message
	  "killed"! How to overcome this problem?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Dar needs
	virtual memory to
	work. Virtual memory is the RAM + SWAP
	space. Dar memory requirement grows with the amount of file saved, not
	with the amount of data saved. If you have a few huge files you will
	have little chance to see any memory limitation problem. At the
	opposite, saving a plethora of files (either big or small), will make
	dar request an increasing amount of virtual memory. Dar needs this memory to build the
	<i>catalogue</i> (the contents) of the backup it creates. Same thing, for
	differential backup, except it also needs to load in memory the
	<i>catalogue</i> of the backup of reference, which most of the time will make
	dar using twice more memory when doing a differential backup than a
	full backup.
      <p/>
      <p>
	Anyway, the
	solution is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Read the <a href="Limitations.html">limitatons file</a> to
	  understand the problem and
	  be
	  aware of the limitations you will bring at step 3, bellow.
	</li>
        <li>If you can, add swap space to your system (under Linux, you
	  can either add a swap partition or a swap file, which is less constraining
	  but also a bit less efficient). Bob Barry provided a script that can
	  give you a raw estimation of the required virtual memory
	  (<a href="samples/index.html">doc/samples/dar_rqck.bash</a>).
	</li>
        <li>
	  If this is not enough, or if you don't want/cannot add swap
	  space, recompile dar giving --enable-mode=64 argument to the configure script.
	</li>
        <li>
	  If this is not enough, and you have some money, you can add
	  some RAM on you system
	</li>
        <li>If all that fails, ask for support on the
	  <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dar-support">dar-support mailing-list</a>.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	Last, there is always the workaround to make several smaller backups
	of the files to save. For example, making a backup for all that is in
	/usr/local, another one for all that is in /var and so on. These backup can be full
	or differential. The drawback is not big as you can store these
	backups side by side and use them at will. Moreover, you can feed a
	unique dar_manager database with all these different backups
	which will hide you the fact that there are several full and
	several differential backups concerning different set of files.
      </p>

      <a name="A8" id="A8"><b>I have a backup I want to change the size of slices?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	<code>dar_xform</code> is your friend!
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	dar_xform -s &lt;size&gt; original_backup new_backup
      </code>

      <p><code>dar_xform</code>
	will create a new backup file with the slices of the requested
	size, (you can also make use of -S option for the first slice). Note
	that you don't need to decrypt the backup, not dar will uncompress it,
	this is thus a very fast processing. See <a href="man/index.html">dar_xform
	  man page</a> for more.
      </p>

      <a name="A9" id="A9"><b>I have a backup in one slice, how can I split it in several slices?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	<code>dar_xform</code> is your friend!
      </p>
      <p>
	see just above.
      </p>

      <a name="A10" id="A10"><b>I have a backup in several slice, how can I stick all them in a single file?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	<code>dar_xform</code> is your friend!
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	dar_xform original_backup new_backup
      </code>
      <p>
	dar_xform without <code>-s</code> option creates a single sliced backup.
	See <a href="man/index.html">dar_xform man page</a> for more.
      </p>

      <a name="A11" id="A11"><b>I have a backup, how can I change its encryption scheme?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	The merging feature let you do
	that. The merging has two roles, putting
	in one backup the contents of two different backups, and at the same time
	filtering out some files you decided not to include into the resulting
	backup. The merging feature can take two but also only one backup as
	input. This is what we will use and without any filter to keep all saved files.
      <p>
	<ul>
          <li>a single input (our original backup)</li>
          <li>no file filtering (so we keep all the files)</li>
          <li>
	    keeping files compressed (no decompression/re compression) to
	    speed up the process (<code>-ak</code> option)
          </li>
	</ul>
	<code class=block>
	  dar -+ new_backup -A original_backup -K "&lt;new_algo&gt;:new pass" -ak
	</code>
      <p>
	If you don't want to have password in
	clear on the command line (command that can be seen for example with <i>top</i>
	or <i>ps</i> by other users), simply provide
	<code>"&lt;algo&gt;:"</code> then dar will ask you on the fly for the password. If using
	blowfish you can then just provide <code>":"</code>
	for the keys. Note that before release 2.5.0, -J option was needed to provide
	the password of the source backup. Since then, without -J option, dar will ask interactively
	for the password of the backup to read. You can still use -J
	option to provide the password from a DCF file and this way avoid dar interactively asking for it.
      </p>
      <p>
	Note that you can also change slicing of the backup at the same time
	thanks to -s and -S options:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	dar -+ new_backup -A original_backup -K ":" -ak -s 1G
      </code>
      <br/>

      <a name="A12" id="A12"><b>I have a backup, how can I change its compression algorithm?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Same thing as above: we will use the merging feature:
      </p>

      <p>
	to use bzip2 compression:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	dar -+ new_backup -A original_backup -zbzip2
      </code>

      <p>
	to use gzip compression
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	dar -+ new_backup -A original_backup -zgzip
      </code>

      <p>
	to use lzo compression, use <code>-zlzo</code>, for LZ4 use
	<code>-zlz4</code>, for zstd use <code>-lzstd</code> and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
	To use no compression at all, do no add any -z option or exclude all files from compression (<code>-Z "*"</code>):
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	dar -+ new_backup -A original_backup
      </code>
      <br/>

      <p>
	Note that you can also change encryption scheme and slicing at the same
	time you change compression:
      </p>

      <code class=block>
	dar -+ new_backup -A original_backup -zbzip2 -K ":" -J ":" -s 1G
      </code>
      <br/>

      <a name="A13"><b>Which options can I use with which options?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	DAR provides seven commands:
      </p>
      <dl>
	<dd><code>-c</code> to create a new backup</dd>
	<dd><code>-x</code> to extract files from a given backup</dd>
	<dd><code>-l</code> to list the contents of a given backup</dd>
	<dd><code>-d</code> to compare the contents of a backup with filesystem</dd>
	<dd><code>-t</code> to test the internal coherence of a given backup</dd>
	<dd><code>-C</code> to isolate a backup (extract its contents to a usually small file) or make a snapshot of the current filesystem</dd>
	<dd><code>-+</code> to merge two backups in one or create a sub
	  backup from one or two other ones</dd>
	<dd><code>-y</code> to repair a backup</dd>

      <a name="A14"><b>Why dar reports corruption of the backup I have transfered with FTP?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Dar backups
	are binary files,
	they must be transfered in
	binary mode
	when using FTP. This is done in the following way for the ftp
	command-line client :
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	ftp &lt;somewhere&gt;
	&lt;login&gt;
	&lt;password&gt;
	<e>bin</e>
	put &lt;file&gt;
	get &lt;file&gt;
	bye
      </code>

      <p>
	If you transfer a backup (or
	any other binary file) in ascii mode (the opposite of binary mode), the
	8th bit of each byte will be lost and the backup will become
	impossible to recover (due to the destruction of this information). Be
	very careful to test your backup after transferring back to you host
	to be sure you can delete the original file.
      </p>


      <a name="UIDGID"><b> Why DAR does save UID/GID
	  instead of plain usernames and usergroups?</b></a><br/>
      <p>In each file property is
	not present the name of the owner nor the name of the group owner, but
	instead are present two numbers, the user ID and the group ID (UID
	&amp; GID in short). The /etc/password file associates to these numbers
	a names and some other properties (like the login shell, the
	home directory, the password, see also /etc/shadow).
	Thus, when you do a directory list (with the 'ls' command for example
	or with any GUI program for another example), the listing application
	used
	does open each directory, there it finds a list of name and a inode
	number associated, then the listing program fetchs the inode attributes
	for each file and looks among other information for the UID and the
	GID. To be able
	to display the real user name and group name, the listing application
	use a well-defined standard C library call that will do the lookup in
	/etc/password, eventually NIS system if configured and any other
	additional
	system, [this way applications have not to bother with the many system
	configuration possible, the same API interface is used whatever is the
	system], then lookup returns the name if it exist and the listing
	application displays for each
	file found in a directory the attributes and the user name and group
	name as returned by the system instead of the UID and GID.
      </p>
      <p>
	As you can see, the user name and
	group name are not part of any file attribute, but UID and GID *are*
	instead. Dar is a backup tool mainly, it does preserve as much as
	possible the file properties to be able to restore them as close as
	possible
	to their original state. Thus a file saved with UID=3 will be restored
	with UID=3. The name corresponding the UID 3 may exist or not,&nbsp;
	may exist and be the same or may exist and be different, the file will
	be anyway restored in UID 3.
      </p>

      <p><u>Scenario with dar's way of restoring</u></p>

      <p>
	Thus, when doing backup and
	restoration of a crashed system you can be confident, the restoration
	will not interfere with the bootable system you have used to launch dar
	to restore your disk. Assuming you have UID 1 labeled <i>'bin'</i> in your
	real crashed system, but this UID 1 is labeled <i>'admin'</i> in the boot
	system, while UID 2 is labeled <i>'bin'</i>
	in this boot system, files owned
	by <i>bin</i> in the system to
	restore will be restored under UID 1, not UID 2
	which is used by the temporary boot system. At that time after
	restoration still running the from the boot system, if you do a 'ls'
	you will see that the original files
	owned by <i>'bin'</i> are now owned
	by user <i>'admin'.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
	This is really a mirage: in your restoration you will also restore the <i>/etc/password</i>
	file and other system configuration files (like NIS configuration files if they have
	been used), then at reboot time on the newly restored real system, the UID 1 will
	be backed associated to user <i>'bin'</i>
	as expected and files originally owned by user <i>bin</i> will now been listed as owned
	by <i>bin</i> as expected.
      </p>

      <p><u>Scenario with plain name way of restoring</u></p>

      <p>
	If dar had done else, restoring
	the files owned by <i>'bin'</i> to
	the UID corresponding to <i>'bin',</i>
	these files would have been given UID 2 (the one used by the temporary
	bootable system used to launch dar). But once the real restored system
	would have been launched, this UID 2 would have become some other user and
	not <i>'bin'</i> which is mapped to
	UID 1 in the restored <i>/etc/password.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
	Now, if you want to change some
	UID/GID when moving a set of files from
	one live system to another system, there is no problem if you are <i>not</i>
	restoring dar under the <i>'root'</i>
	account. Other account than <i>'root'</i> are
	usually not allowed to modify UID/GID, thus restored files by dar will
	have group and user ownership of the dar process, which is the one that
	has launched dar.
      </p>

      <p>
	But if you really need to move a
	directory tree containing a set of files with different ownership and
	you want to preserve these different ownership from one live system to
	another, while the corresponding UID/GID do not match between the two
	system, dar can still help you:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>Save your directory tree on the source live system</li>
	<li>
	  From the root account in the destination live system do the
	  following:
	</li>
	<li>restore the backup content in a empty directory</li>
	<li>
	  change the UID of files according to the one used by the
	  destination filesystem with the command:
	  <code class=block>
	    find /path/to/restored/backup -uid &lt;old UID&gt; -print -exec chown &lt;new name&gt; {} \;
	    find /path/to/restored/backup -gid &lt;old GID&gt; -print -exec chgrp &lt;new name&gt; {} \;
	  </code>
	  The first command will let you
	  remap an UID to another for all files
	  under the /path/to/restored/backup directory<br/>
	  The second command will let you remap a GID to another for all files
	  under the /path/to/restored/backup directory
	</li>
      </ul>


      <u>Example on how to globally modify ownership of a directory tree user by user</u><br/>

      <p>
	For example, you have on the <i>source</i> system three users: Pierre
	(UID 100), Paul (UID 101), Jacques (UID 102)
	but on the <i>destination</i> system,
	these same users are mapped to
	different UID: Pierre has UID 101, Paul has UID 102 and Jacques has UID 100.
      </p>
      <p>
	We temporary need an unused UID on the destination system, we will
	assume UID 680 is not used. Then after the backup restoration in the
	directory /tmp/A we will do the following:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	find /tmp/A -uid 100 -print -exec chown 680 {} \;
	find /tmp/A -uid 101 -print -exec chown pierre {} \;
	find /tmp/A -uid 102 -print -exec chown paul {} \;
	find /tmp/A -uid 680 -print -exec chown jacques&nbsp; {} \;
      </code>
      <p>
	which is:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  change files of UID 100 to UID 680 (the files of Jacques are now under
	  the temporary UID 680 and UID 100 is now freed)
	</li>
	<li>
	  change files of UID 101 to UID 100 (the files of Pierre get their UID
	  of the destination live system, UID 101 is now freed)
	</li>
	<li>
	  change files of UID 102 to UID 101 (the files of Paul get their UID of
	  the destination live system, UID 102 is now freed)
	</li>
	<li>
	  change files of UID 680 to UID 102 (the files of Jacques which had been
	  temporarily moved to UID 680 are now set to their UID on the
	  destination live system, UID 680 is no more used).
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	You can then move the modified
	files to appropriated destination or
	make a new dar backup to be restored in appropriated place if you want
	to use some of dar's feature like for example only restore files that
	are more recent than those present on filesystem.
      </p>
      <a name="Dar_Manager_encrypted"><b>Dar_Manager does not accept encrypted backups, how to workaround this?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Yes, that's true, dar_manager
	does not accept encrypted backups. The
	first reason is that while dar_manager database cannot be encrypted
	this is not very fair to add to them encrypted backups. The second
	reason is because the dar_manager database should hold the key for each
	encrypted backup making this backup the weakest point in your data
	security: Breaking the database encryption would then provide
	access to any encryption key, and with original backup access it would
	bring access to data of any of the backup added to the database.
      <p>
	To workaround this, you can proceed as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  isolate your encrypted backup into an unencrypted 'isolated
	  catalogue': Do not use the -K option while isolating.
	  Without -J option dar will prompt for the password of the encrypted
	  archive. For automated process, you are encouraged to use
	  a DCF file with restricted permissions and
	  containing the '-J &lt;key&gt;' option to be passed for dar. The instruct
	  dar to read that file thanks to -B option.
	</li>
	<li>
	  add these extracted catalogue to the dar_manager database
	  of your choice,
	</li>
	<li>
	  change the name and path of the added catalogue to point to
	  your real encrypted backups (-b and -p options of dar_manager).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Note that as the database is not
	encrypted this will expose the backup
	file listing (not the file's contents) of your encrypted backups to
	anyone able to read the database, thus it is recommended to set
	restrictive permission to this database file.
      </p>
      <p>
	When will come the time to use dar_manager to restore some file, you
	will have to make dar_manager pass the key to dar for it be able to
	restore the needed files from the backup. This can be done in several
	ways: dar_manager's command-line, dar_manager database or dar.dcf file.
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  dar_manager's command-line: simply pass the -e "-K
	  &lt;key&gt;" to dar_manager . Note that this will expose the key twice:
	  on dar_manager's command-line and on dar's command-line.
	</li>
	<li>
	  dar_manager database: the database can store some constant
	  command to be passed to dar. This is done using the -o option, or the
	  -i option. The -o option exposes the arguments you want to be passed to
	  dar because they are on dar_manager command-line. While the -i option,
	  let you do the same thing but in an interactive manner, this is a
	  better choice.
	</li>
	<li>
	  A better way is to use a DCF file with restrictive
	  permission. This one will receive the '-K &lt;key&gt;' option for dar
	  to be able to read the encrypted backups. And dar_manager will ask dar
	  to read this file thanks to the '-B &lt;filename&gt;' option you will
	  have given either on dar_manager's command-line (-e -B &lt;filename&gt;
	  ...) or from the stored option in the database (-o -B &lt;filename&gt;).
	</li>
	<li>
	  The best way is let dar_manager pass the -K option to dar,
	  but without password : simply passing the -e "-K :" option to
	  dar_manager. When dar will get the -K option with the ":" argument, it
	  will dynamically ask for the password and store it in a secured memory.
	</li>
      </ol>

      <a name="staticOSX"><b>How to overcome the lack of static linking on MacOS X?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	The answer comes from Dave
	Vasilevsky in an email to the dar-support
	mailing-list. I let him explain how to do:
      </p>

      <div style="font-style:italic; margin-left:25px;">
	<p>
	  Pure-static
	  executables aren't used on OS X.
	  However, Mac OS X does have other ways to build portable binaries.
	  HOWTO build portable binaries on OS X?
	</p>
	<p>
	  First, you have to make sure
	  that dar only uses operating-system
	  libraries that exist on the oldest version of OS X that you care about.
	  You do this by specifying one of Apple's SDKs, for example:
	</p>
	<code class=block>
	  export CPPFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.2.8.sdk"
	  export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.2.8.sdk"
	</code>
	<p>
	  Second, you have to make sure
	  that any non-system libraries that dar
	  links to are linked in statically. To do this edit
	  dar/src/dar_suite/Makefile, changing LDADD to
	  '../libdar/.libs/libdar.a'. If any other non-system
	  libs are used (such as gettext), change the
	  makefiles so they are also linked in
	  statically. Apple should really give us a way to force the linker to do this
	  automatically!
	</p>
	<p>
	  Some caveats:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>If you build for 10.3 or
	    lower, you will not get EA support, and
	    therefore you will not be able to save special Mac information like
	    resource forks.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    To work on both ppc and x86
	    Macs, you need to build a universal
	    binary. For instructions, use Google -)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    To make a 10.2-compatible
	    binary, you must build with GCC 3.3.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    These instructions won't work
	    for the 10.1 SDK, that one is harder to
	    use.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </div>

      <a name="single_slice"><b>Why cannot I test, extract file, list the contents of a given slice from a backup?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	Well this is due to dar's design. However you can list a whole backup and see
	in which slice(s) a file is located:
      </p>

      <code class=block>
	<b># dar -l test <e>-Tslice</e> -g etc/passwd</b>
	<e>Slice(s)</e>|[Data ][D][ EA  ][FSA][Compr][S]|Permission| Filemane
	--------+--------------------------------+----------+-----------------------------

	<e>2</e>        [Saved][ ]       [-L-][  63%][ ] -rw-r--r-- etc/passwd
	-----
	All displayed files have their data in slice range [1-2]
	-----
	<b>#</b>
      </code>
      <br/>

      <a name="merge_two_isolated"><b>Why cannot I merge two isolated catalogues?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Since version 2.4.0, isolated catalogues can also be used to rescue an
	corrupted internal catalogue of the backup it has been isolated from.
	For that feature be possible, a mecanism let dar know if an given
	isolated catalogue and a given backup correspond to the same contents.
	Merging two isolated catalogues would break this feature as the
	resulting backup would not match any real backup an could only be
	used as reference for a differential backup.
      </p>

      <a name="parallel"><b>How to use the full power of my multi-processor computer?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Since release 2.7.0 it is possible to have dar efficiently using many threads at two independent levels:
      </p>
      <dl>
	<dt class=void>encryption</dt><dd>
	  You can specify the number of thread to use to cipher/decipher a backup. Note however
	  that during tests done for 2.7.0 validation, it was observed that having more
	  than two threads for encryption does not gives better results than using only two threads
	  when compression is used, because most of the time compression is more CPU intensive
	  than encryption (well all depends on the chosen algorithms, that's right).
	</dd>
	<dt class=void>compression</dt><dd>
	  Before release 2.7.0 compression was done per file in streaming mode. In this
	  mode to compress data you need to know the result of the compression of the data that
	  is located before it, this brings good compression ratio but is impossible to
	  parallelize. To be able to compress in parallel one need to split data in block,
	  and compress blocks independently. There you can use a lot of threads up to the time
	  when this is the disk I/O that is the slowest process. Adding more compression
	  thread will not change the result. The drawback of compressing per thread is less
	  the compression ratio that is slightly less good than in stream compression mode, than
	  the memory requirement to hold a data block of clear data per thread and the compressed
	  resulting data, times the number of threads. To avoid having any thread waiting for
	  disk I/O, you even have to store a bit more memory block than the number of threads,
	  this is managed by libdar.

      </dl>
      <p>
	To activate multi-threading with dar, use the <code>-G</code> option, read the dar man page
	for all details about the way to define the number of encryption thread and the number of
	compression thread, as well as the compression block size to use.

      <a name="threadsafe"><b>Is libdar thread-safe, which way do you mean it is?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	libdar is the part of dar's
	source code that has been rewritten to be used by external programs
	(like kdar). It has been modified to be used in a multi-threaded
	environment, thus, <b>*yes*, libdar is thread-safe</b>.
	However, thread-safe does not mean that you do not have to take some
	precautions in your programs while using libdar (or any other library).
      </p>
      <p>
	Care must thus be taken for two different threads
	<b>not acting on the same variables/objects at the same time</b>.
	This is however possible with the use of posix mutex, which would
	define a portion of code (known as a critical section) that cannot be
	entered by more than one thread at a time.
      </p>

	A few objects provided by libdar API supports the concurrent access
	from several threads, read the API documentation for more.

      <a name="slow_2_4_0"><b>Why dar became much slower since release 2.4.0?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	This is the drawback of new features!
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Espetially	to be able to read dar backup through pipes in
	  sequential mode, dar inserts so-called "escape sequence" to know
	  for example when a new file starts. This way dar can skip to the next
	  mark upon backup corruption or if the given file has not to be
	  restored. However, if such a sequence of byte is found into a file's
	  data, it must be modified not to collide with real escape sequences.
	  This leads dar to inspect all data added to a backup for
	  such sequence of byte, instead of just copying the data to the backup
	  (eventually compressing and cyphering it).
	</li>
	<li>
	  The other feature that brings an important overhead is the
	  sparse file detection mechanism. To be able to detect a hole in a file
	  and store it into the backup, dar needs here too, to inspect each
	  file's data.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	You can disable both of these features, using respectively the options <code><b>-at</b></code>
	option, which suppress "tape marks" (just another name for escape
	sequences), but does not allow the generated backup to be used in
	sequential read mode, and <b><code>-1 0</b></code>
	option, which completely disables the sparse file detection. The
	execution time becomes back the same as the one of dar 2.3.x releases.
      </p>

      <a name="slow_2_5_0"><b>Why dar became yet slower since release 2.5.0?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	This is again the drawback of new features!
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The first feature that drain time is <b>Filesystem Specific Attributes (FSA)</b>,
	  as it requires new system calls for each new files to save. This has
	  little impact when saving a lot of big files but become visible when
	  saving a lot a tiny files or directories.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The second feature is the use of <b>fadvise()</b>
	  system call that preserves
	  cache usage. In other words dar tells the system it does not need
	  anymore a file when it has been read (backup) or written (restoration)
	  this has the advantage to reduce cache presure from dar to the benefit
	  of other running process needs. The idea here is to preserves as much
	  as possible a live operating system from being affected by a running
	  backup relying on dar. The consequence is that if running dar a second
	  time on the same set of file, with dar 2.4.x and below the data to save
	  was most of the time in the cache which could lead to very fast
	  execution, while with dar 2.5.x the data to save may have been flushed
	  out of the cache by more important data for another application. This
	  second time dar is run, the data has to be read again from disk which
	  does not bring the same very fast execution as reading from cache.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	You can disable both of these features. The first can be disabled <b>at compilation time</b>
	giving <code><b>--disable-fadvise</b></code> to the <code>./configure</code> script.
	The second option can be disabled at any time by adding the
	<code><b>--fsa-scope=none</b></code> option to <code>dar</code>.
	The execution time becomes back then the same as the one of dar 2.4.x releases.

      <a name="open_failed_excluded"><b>Why dar tells me that he failed to open a directory, while I have excluded this directory?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	Reading the contents of a
	directory is done using the usual system call
	(opendir/readdir/closedir). The first call (opendir) let dar design
	which directory to inspect, the dar call readdir to get the next entry
	in the opened directory. Once nothing has to be read, closedir is
	called. The problem here is that dar cannot start reading a directory
	do some treatment and start reading another directory. In brief, the
	opendir/readdir/closedir system call are not re-entrant.
      </p>
      <p>
	This is in particular critical for dar as it does a depth lookup in the
	directory tree. In other words, from the root if we have two
	directories A and B, dar reads A's contents, the contents of its
	subdirectories, then once finished, it read the next entry of the root
	directory (which is B), then read the contents of B and then of each of
	its subdirectories, then once finished for B, it must go back to the
	root again, and read the next entry. In the meanwhile dar had to open
	many directories to get their contents.
      </p>
      <p>
	For this reason dar caches the directory contents (when it first meet a
	directory, it read its whole content and stores it in the RAM). This is
	only after, that dar decide whether to include or not a given
	directory. But at this point then, its contents has already been read
	thus you may get the message that dar failed to read a given directory
	contents, while you explicitly specify not to include that particular
	directory in the backup.
      </p>

      <a name="security"><b>Dar reports a
	  <code>SECURITY WARNING! SUSPICIOUS FILE</code> what does that mean!?</b>
      </a><br/>

      <p>
	When dar reports the following message:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	SECURITY WARNING! SUSPICIOUS FILE &lt;filepath&gt;: ctime changed since backup of reference was done, while no inode or data changed
      </code>

      <p>
	You should be concerned by finding an explanation to the root cause
	that triggered dar to ring this alarm. As you probably know, a unix
	file has three (sometimes four) dates:
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li><b>atime</b> is changed
	  anytime you read the file's contents or write to it (this is the last <b>a</b>ccess time)
	</li>
	<li><b>mtime</b> is changed
	  anytime you write to the file's data (this is the last <b>m</b>odification time)
	</li>
	<li><b>ctime</b> is changed
	  anythime ou modify the file's attributes (the is the last <b>c</b>hange time)
	</li>
	<li><b>btime</b> is never changed once a file has been created (this is the <b>b</b>irth time or creation time),
	  not all filesystem do provide it.
      </ol>

      <p>
	In other words:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>if you only read the data of file, only its <b>atime</b> will be updated<sup>1</sup></li>
	<li>if you write some data to a file, its <b>ctime</b> and <b>mtime</b> will change, atime will stay unchanged</li>
	<li>if you change ownership, permission, extended attributes, etc. only <b>ctime</b> will change</li>
	<li>if you write to a file and modify its atime or mtime to let think the file has not been read or modified, <b>ctime</b> will change in any case.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	Yes, the point is that in most (if not all) unix systems, over the
	kernel itself, user program can also manually set the atime
	and mtime manually to any arbitrary  value
	(see the "touch" command for example), but to my knowledge, no system
	provides a mean to manually set the ctime of a file. This value cannot
	thus be faked.
      </p>
      <p>
	However, some rootkits and other nasty programs that tend to hide
	themselves from the system administrator use this trick and modify the
	mtime to become more difficult to detect. Thus, the ctime keeps track
	of the date and time of their infamy. However, ctime may also change
	while neither mtime nor atime do, in several almost rare but normal
	situations. Thus, if you are faced to this message, you should first verify the
	following points before thinking your system has been infected by a
	rootkit:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  have you added or removed a hardlink pointing to that file
	  and this file's data has not been modified since last backup?
	</li>
	<li>
	  have you changed this file's extended attributs (including Linux ACL and
	  MacOS file forks) while file's data has not been modified since last
	  backup?
	</li>
	<li>
	  have you recently restored your data and are now performing
	  a differential backup taking as reference the backup used to restore
	  that same data? Or in other words, does that particular file has just
	  been restored from a backup (was removed by accident for example)?
	</li>
	<li>
	  have you just moved from a dar version older than release
	  2.4.0 to dar version 2.4.0 or more recent?
	</li>
	<li>
	  have you upgraded the package this file is part of since
	  last backup?
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	How to know atime/mtime/ctime of a file?
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>mtime is provided by the command: <code>ls -l</code></li>
	<li>atime is provided by the command : <code>ls -l --time=atime</code></li>
	<li>ctime is provided by the command : <code>ls -l --time=ctime</code></li>
	<li>the <code>stat</code> command provides all dates of a given file: <code>stat &lt;filename&gt;</code></li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
	<dt class=void>Note:</dt>
	<dd>
	  With dar
	  version older than 2.4.0 (by default, unless -aa option is use) once a
	  file has been read for backup, dar set back the atime to the value it
	  had before dar read it. This trick was used to accomodate some programs
	  like leafnode (NNTP caching program) that base their cache purging
	  scheme on the atime of files. When you do a backup using dar 2.3.11 for
	  example, file that had their mtime modified are saved as expected and
	  their atime is set back to their original values (value they had just
	  before dar read them), which has the slide effect to modify the ctime.
	  If then you upgrade to dar 2.4.0 or more recent and do a differential
	  backup, if that same file has not been modified since, dar will see
	  that the ctime has changed while no other metadata did (user,
	  ownership, group, mtime), thus this alarm message will show for all
	  saved files in the last 2.3.11 backup made. The next differential
	  backup made using dar 2.4.0 (or more recent), the problem will not show
	  anymore.
	</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
	Well, if you cannot find an valid explanation from the one presented
	above, you'd better consider that your system has been infected by a
	rootkit or a virus and use all the necessary tools (see below for
	examples) to find some evidence of it.

      <a name="copy"><b>Can dar help copy a large directory tree?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	The answer is "yes" and even for more than one reason:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
	  Many backup/copy tools do not take care of hard linked
	  inode (hard linked plain files, named pipes, char devices, block
	  devices, symlinks)... dar does,
	</li>
        <li>
	  Many backup/copy tools do not take care of sparse files... dar does,
	</li>
        <li>
	  Many backup/copy tools do not take care of Extended Attributes... dar does,
	</li>
        <li>Many backup/copy tools do not take care of Posix ACL
	  (Linux)... dar does,
	</li>
        <li>Many backup/copy tools do not take care of file forks
	  (MacOS X)... dar does,
	</li>
        <li>Many backup/copy tools do not take any precautions while
	  working on a live system... dar does.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	Using the following command will
	do the trick without relying on temporary file or backup:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	dar -c - -R &lt;srcdir&gt; --retry-on-change 3 -N | dar -x - --sequential-read -N -R &lt;dstdir&gt;
      </code>

      <p>
	<code>&lt;srcdir&gt;</code> contents will be copied to <code>&lt;dstdir&gt;</code>
	both must exist before running this command, and <code>&lt;dstdir&gt;</code>
	should be an empty dir.
      </p>
      <p>
	Here is an example: we will copy the content of /home/my to /home2/my.
	first we create the destination directory, then we run <code>dar</code>
      </p>

      <code class=block>
	mkdir /home2/my
	dar -c - -R /home/my --retry-on-change 3 | dar -x - --sequential-read -R /home2/my
      </code>

      <p>
	The <code>--retry-on-change</code> let dar
	retry the copy of a file up to three times if that file has changed at
	the time dar was reading it. You can increase this number at will. If a
	file fails to be copied correctly after more than the allowed retry, a
	warning is issued about that file and it is flagged as dirty in the
	data flow, the second dar command will then ask you whether you want it
	to be restored (here copied) on not.
      </p>
      <p>
	"piping" ('|' shell syntax) the first dar's output to the second dar's
	input makes the operation not requiering any temporary storage, only
	virtual memory is used to perform this copy. Compression is thus not
	requested as it would only slow down the whole process.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>last point,</b> you
	should compare the copied data to the original one, before removing it,
	as no backup file has been dropped down to filesystem. This can simply
	be done using:
	<code class=block>
	  diff -r &lt;srcdir&gt; &lt;dstdir&gt;
	</code>
      <p>
	But, no, diff will not check extended Attributes, File Forks or Posix
	ACL, hard linked inodes, etc. If you want a more controlable way of
	copying a large directory, simply use dar with a real backup file,
	compare the backup toward the original filesystem, restore the backup
	contents to its new place, and compare the restored filesystem toward
	the original backup.
      </p>
      <p>
	Any better idea? Feel free to contact dar's author for an update of
	this documentation!
      </p>

      <a name="compression"><b>Does dar compress per file or the whole backup?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	Dar uses compression (gzip, lzo, bzip2, xz/lzma, zstd, lz4, ...) with different level of
	compression (1 for quick but
	low compression up to 9 for best
	compression but slower execution) on <u>a file by file basis</u>.
	I other words, the compression engine is reset for each new file added
	into the backup. When a corruption occurs in a
	file like a compressed <i>tar</i>
	backup, it is not possible to decompress the data passed
	that corruption, with tar you loose all files stored after such data
	corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
	Having compression per file has instead the <u>advantage</u>
	to only impact one file inside the backup and all files that are
	stored before or after such data corruption can still be restored from
	that corrupted backup. Compressing per file opens the possibility to
	not compress all files in the
	backup, in particular already compressed files (like *.jpeg, *.mpeg, some *.avi
	files and of course the *.gz, *.bz2 or *.lzo files). Avoiding
	compressing already compressed files save CPU cycles (in other words
	it speeds up backup process time). And while compressing an already
	compressed file takes time for nothing, it also leads to require more storage space
	than if that same file was not compressed a second tim
      </p>
      <p>
	The <u>drawback</u> is that the
	overall compression ratio is slightly less good.
      </p>
      <p>
	How to activate compression with dar? Use the
	<code><b>--compression</b></code>
	option (or -z in short), telling the algorithm to use and the
	compression level (--compression=bzip2:9 or -zgip:7 for example), you
	may not mention the compression ratio (which default to 9) and even not
	mention the compression algorithm which default to gzip. Thus -z or
	-zlzo are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
	To select file to compress or not compress, several options are
	available: <code><b>--exclude-compression</b></code>
	(or -Z in short --- the uppercase Z here) <code><b>--include-compression</b></code>
	(or -Y in short). Both take as argument a mask that based on their
	names define files that have to be compressed or not to be compressed. For
	example <code>-Z "*.avi" -Z "*.mp?" -Z "*.mpeg"</code> will avoid compressing MPEG,
	MP3, MP2 and AVI files. Note that dar provides in its <code>/etc/darrc</code>
	default configuration file, a long list of -Z options to avoid compressing
	most common compressed files, that you can activate by simply adding
	<code><b>compress-exclusion</b></code> on dar command-line.
      </p>
      <p>
	In addition to excluding/including files from compression based on
	their name, you can also exclude small files (for which compression
	ratio is usually poor) using the <code><b>--mincompr</b></code>
	option which takes a size as argument: <code>--mincompr 1k</code> will avoid compressing
	files which size is less than or equal to 1024 bytes. You should find
	all details about these options in <a href="man/dar.html">dar man page</a>.
	Check also the <code>-am</code> and <code>-ar</code> options to
	understand how <code>--exclude-compression</code>and
	<code>--include-compression</code> interact with
	each other, or how to use <i>regular expression</i>s in place of
	<i>glob expressions</i> in masks.
      </p>

      <a name="sizes"><b>What slice size can I use with dar?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	The <b>minimum slice size is around 20 bytes</b>,
	but you will only be able to store 3 to 4 bytes of information per
	slice, due to the slice header that need around 15 bytes in each slice (this vary
	depending on options used and may increase in future backup version
	format). <b>But there is no maximum slice size!</b>
	In other words you can give to <code>-s</code> and <code>-S</code> options
	an as long as required positive integer, thanks to its internal own
	integer type named "<i>infinint</i>"
	dar is able to handle arbitrarily large
	integers (file offset, file size, etc.).
      </p>
      <P>
	You can make use of suffixes like 'k' for kilo, M for mega, G for giga
	etc... (<a href="usage_notes.html#bytes_bits_kilo">all suffixes are
	  listed here</a>) to simplify your work. See also
	the <code>-aSI </code>and <code>-abinary</code> options to swap meaning
	between ko (= 1000 octets) kio (= 1024 octets).
      </p>
      <p>
	Last point dar/libdar can be compiled using the --enable-mode=64 option
	given to ./configure while building dar (this is the default since release 2.6.0).
	This replaces the "infinint" type by 64 bits integers, for better performances and reduced memory usage.
	However this has some drawback on backup size and dates. See the <a href="Limitations.html">limitations</a> for more details.<br/>
	Since release 2.6.0 the default being the 64 bits mode, to have dar/libdar using <i>infinint</i>
	one need to use the following option <code>./configure --enable-mode=infinint</code>.

      <a name="diff"><b>Why when comparing a backup with filesystem, dar does not report new files found on filesystem?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	Backup comparison (<code>-d</code> option) is
	to be seen as a step further than
	backup testing (<code>-t</code> option) where dar checks the backup internal
	structure and usability. The step further here is not only to check
	that each part of the backup is readable and has a correct associated
	CRC but also that it matches what is present on filesystem. So yes, if
	new files are present on filesystem, nothing has to be reported. If a
	file changed, dar reports that the file does not match what's in the
	backup, if a file is missing dar cannot compare it with filesystem
	and reports an error too.
      </p>
      <p>
	So you want to know what has changed on your filesystem?
	No problem, <b>do a differential backup!</b>

      <p>
	Once the operation has completed, you can list

      <code class=block>
	dar -l &lt;isolated&gt; -as
      </code>
      <p>
	It will give you the exact difference between your current filesystem
	and the filesystem at the time the <code>&lt;ref backup&gt;</code> was done:
	modified files and new files are reported with <code>[inref]</code> for either data EA or both,
	while deleted files are reported by <code>[--- REMOVED ENTRY ----]</code>
	information, followed by the estimated removal date and the type of the
	removed file (<code>[-]</code> for plain file, <code>[d]</code> for directory, and so on. More
	details in dar man page for listing command).

      <a name="delta"><b>Why dar does not automatically perform delta difference (aka rsync increment)?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	Because delta different is subject in theory to checksum collision (but it is very
	unprobable though), which could lead a new version of a file being seen
	the same as an older one while some changes took place in it. A second
	reason is to take care of users preference, that do not want
	having this feature activated by default. Well, now, activating delta
	difference with dar is quite simple and flexible, see <a href="usage_notes.html#delta">note</a>.<br/>
      </p>

      <a name="cyrillic"><b>Why do dar reports truncated filenames under Windows, especially with cyrillic filenames?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	Dar/libdar has been first
	developer for Linux. It has been later ported to many other operating
	systems. For Unix-like system (FreeBSD, Solaris, ...), it can run as a
	native program by just recompiled it for the target OS and processor.
	For Windows system, it cannot because Unix and Windows systems do not
	provide the same system calls at all. The easiest way to have dar
	running under Windows was to rely on Cygwin, which translates the Unix
	system calls to Windows system calls. However Cygwin brings some
	limitations. One of them is that it cannot provide filenames longer
	than 256 bytes, while today's Windows can have much longer filenames.
      </p>
      <p>
	What the point with cyrillic filenames? Cyrillic characters unlike most
	latin ones are not stored as a single byte, they usually use several
	bytes per character, thus this maximum file size is reached much
	quicker than with latin filenames, but the problem also exists with
	them.
      </p>
      <p>
	The consequence is that when dar reads a directory that contains a
	large filename, the Cygwin layer is not able to provide it entierly:
	the filename is truncated. When dar wants to read information about
	that filename most of the time such truncated filename does not exists
	and dar reports the message from the system that this file does not
	exists (which might sound strange from user point of view). Since
	release 2.5.4 dar reports instead that filename has been truncated and
	that it will be ignored.
      </p>

      <a name="win32"><b>I have a 32 bits windows system, which binary package can I to use?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	Up to release 2.4.15 (including)
	the dar/libdar binaries for windows were built on a 32 bits windows
	(XP) system. After that release, binaries for windows have been built
	using a 64 bits windows system (7, now 8 and probably 10 soon).
	Unfortunately, the filename of the binary packages for windows do not
	reflect that change and have still been labeled "i386" while included
	binaries do no more supporting i386 CPU family (which are 32 bits CPU).
	This is an oversight that has been unseen until Adrian Buciuman's
	remark in dar-support mailing-list September 23d, 2016. In consequence
	after that date binary packages for windows will receive an additional
	field corresponding to the windows flavor they have been built against.
      </p>
      <p>
	Some may still need 32 bits windows binaries of dar, unfortunately I
	have no more access to such system, but if you have such windows ISO
	image and valid license to give me, I could install it into a virtual
	machine and provide binary packages for 32 bits too.
      </p>
      <p>
	Until then, you can build yourself the binary for windows. Here follows the recipe:
      </p>
      <p>
	install <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> on windows including at least the following packages:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>clang C/C++ compiler</li>
	<li>cygwin devel</li>
	<li>doxygen</li>
	<li>gettext-devel</li>
	<li>liblzo2-devel</li>
	<li>libzzip-devel</li>
	<li>libgpgme-devel</li>
	<li>librsync-devel (starting future release 2.6.0)</li>
	<li>make</li>
	<li>tcsh</li>
	<li>zip<br/>
	</li>
	<li>upx</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	Then get the dar source code and extract its content (either using windows native tools or using tar under cygwin)
	For clarity let's assuming you have extracted dar source package for version x.y.z
	into <code>C:\Temp</code> directory, thus you now have the directory <code>C:\Temp\dar-x.y.z</code>
      </p>
      <p>
	Run a cygwin terminal and "cd" into that directory:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	cd /cygdrive/c/Temp/dar-x.y.z
      </code>
      <p>
	In the previous command, note that from within a cygwin shell, the path
	use slashes not windows backslashes ; note also the 'c' is lowercase
	while windows shows upper case letter for drives...
      </p>
      <p>
	But don't worry, we are almost finished, run the following script:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	misc/batch_cygwin x.y.z
      </code>
      <p>
	starting release 2.5.7 the syntax will change / has changed
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	misc/batch_cygwin x.y.z win32
      </code>
      <p>
	the new "win32" or "win64" field will be used to label the zip package
	containing the dar/libdar binary for windows, that's up to you to
	choose the value corresponding to your OS 32/64 bits flavor.
      </p>
      <p>
	At the end of the process you will get a dar zip file for windows in
	<code>C:\Temp\dar-x.y.z</code> directory.
      </p>
      <p>
	Feel free to ask for support on
	<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dar-support">dar-support mailing-list</a>
	if you enconter any problem building dar binary for windows, this FAQ will be updated accordingly.
      </p>

      <a name="windows_slash"><b>Path slash and back-slash consideration under Windows</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	The paths given to dar's arguments and options
	must respect the UNIX way (use slashes "/" not back
	slashes "\" as it ought to be under Windows)
	thus for example you have to have to use <code>/temp</code>
	in place of <code>\temp</code>
      </p>
      <p>
	Moreover, drive letters cannot be used the usual way, like
	<code><e>c:\</e>windows\system32</code>. Instead you will have to
	give the following path <code><e>/cygdrive/c/</e>windows/system32</code>.
	As you see the <code>/cygdrive</code> directory is a
	virtual directory that has all the drives as children directories:
      </p>
      <p>
	Here is a more global example:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	&nbsp;c:\dar_win-1.2.1\dar -c /cygdrive/f/tmp/toto -s 2G -z1 -R "/cygdrive/c/My Documents"
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;  ^             ^         ^   ^                     ^
	&nbsp;  |             |         |   |                     |
	&nbsp;  ---------------         ---------------------------
	&nbsp; here use anti-slash        but here we use slash
	&nbsp; as usually under           in arguments given to dar
	&nbsp; windows to point
	&nbsp; the command
      </code>

      <a name="windows_root"><b>Under Windows, which directory corresponds to /</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	When running <i>dar</i> from a windows command-line (thus not from cygwin environement), dar's root directory
	is the parent directory of the one holding the <i>dar.exe</i> file. This does not mean that you cannot have dar
	backing up anything outside this directory (you can thanks to the <code>/cygdrive/...</code> path alias seen above),
	but when dar looks for <code>darrc</code> it looks using this parent directory as the "/" root one.
      </p>
      <p>
	Since release 2.6.14, the published dar packages for Windows are configured and built
	in such a way that <i>dar.exe</i> uses the provided <code>darrc</code> file located in the <code>etc</code>
	sub-directory. So <code>darrc</code> is now usable, out of the box.
	However if you rename the directory where <i>dar.exe</i> is located, which name is something like
	<code>dar64-x.y.z-win64</code>, the <i>dar.exe</i> binary will still look for a <code>darrc</code> at
	<code>/dar64-x.y.z-win64/etc/darrc</code>, taking as root directory the parent directory
	of the directory where it resides. You can still then explicitely rely on it by mean of a -B option
	pointing to the modified path where the <code>darrc</code> is located.
      </p>

      <a name="lzop_vs_dar"><b>lzo compression is slower with dar than with lzop, why?</b></a><br/>
      <p>
	when using the "lzo" compression algorithm, <i>dar/libdar</i> always uses the algorithm
	<i>lzo1x_999</i> with the compression level requested
	(from 1 to 9) as argument. Dar thus provides 9 different
	compression/speed levels with lzo.
      </p>
      <p>
	In the other hand, as of today (2017) <i>lzop</i>, the command line tool,
	uses the very degradated lzo algorithm known as <i>lzo1x_1_15</i>
	for level 1 and  the intermediate <i>lzo1x_1</i> algorithm
	for levels from 2 to 6, which makes levels 2 to 6
	totally equivalent from the <i>lzop</i> program point of view.
	Last, compression levels 7 to 9 for <i>lzop</i> uses the same <i>lzo1x_999</i>
	algorithm as what dar/libdar uses, which is the only algorithm of the lzo family
	that makes use of a compression levels. In total lzop only provides 5 different
	compression levels/algorithms only.
      </p>
      <p>
	So now, you know why dar is slower than lzop when using lzo compression at level 1 to 6.
	To get to equivalent feature as <i>lzop</i> provides for level 1 and 2-6,  dar/libdar
	provides two additional lzo-based compression algorithms: <code><b>lzop-1</b></code>
	and <code><b>lzop-3</b></code>. As
	you guess, <code>lzop-1</code> uses the <i>lzo1x_1_15</i> algorithm as lzop does for
	its compression level 1, and <code>lzop-3</code> uses the <i>lzo1x_1</i> algorithm as lzop does
	for its compression levels 2 to 6. For both lzop-1 and lzop-3 algorithms,
	the compression level is not used, you can keep the default or change its value this
	will not change dar behavior.

      <a name="libthreadar"><b>What is libthreadar and why libdar relies on it?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	libthreadar is a wrapping library of the Posix C threads. It was originally part of
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/webdar/">webdar</a>
	a libdar based web server project, but as this code became necessary
	also inside libdar, all this thread relative classes have been put into
	a separated library called libthreadar, that today both webdar and
	libdar rely upon.
      </p>
      <p>
	dar/libdar rely on libthreadar to manage several threads inside libdar,
	which is necessary to efficiently implement the remote repository
	feature based on libcurl (available starting release 2.6.0).
      </p>
      <p>
	<u>Why not using boost library or the thread suppport brought by C++11?</u>
      </p>
      Because first no complier implemented C++11 at the time webdar was
      started and second boost thread was not found to be adapted to the need
      for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  I wanted a more object oriented approach than passing a
	  function to be ran into a separated thread as provided by boost/C++11
	  interface, where from the pure virtual class libthreadar::thread that
	  let you create inherited class from.
	</li>
	<li>
	  I wanted to avoid functions/methods with multiple
	  parameters, as it has shown in the past with libdar to be a source of
	  problem when it comes to backward compatibily while adding new
	  features. Instead the inherited class can provide as many different
	  methods to setup individual parameters before the thread is run()
	</li>
	<li>
	  As a consequence, another need was to be able to set an
	  object before the thread is effectively run, the C++ object existence
	  need not to match the thread existence, in other words the object shall
	  be created first and the thread run() afterward. Of course the
	  destruction of a thread object would kill the thread it is wrapping.
	  The other advantage doing that way was the possibility to re-run() a
	  thread from the same object once a first thread had completed
	  eventually modifying some parameters through the method provided by the
	  inherited class from libthreadar::thread
	</li>
	<li>
	  Last but not least, I wanted to have an exception thrown
	  from within a thread and not caught up to the global thread function
	  (thus leading the thread to end), to be kept over the thread existance
	  and relaunched into the thread calling the join() method for that
	  object. Thus avoiding having a coherent treatment of errors using C++
	  exception when thread were used.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	libthreadar does all this and is a completely independant piece of
	software from both webdar and dar/libdar. So you can use it freely
	(LGPLv3 licensing) if you want. As all project I've been
	published, it is documented as much as possible, feedback is always
	welcome of something is not clear, wrong or missing.
      </p>
      <p>
	libthreadar source code can be found
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/libthreadar/">here</a>,
	documentation is available in source package as well as online
	<a href="http://libthreadar.sourceforge.net/">here</a>

      <a name="sftppubkey"><b>I have sftp pubkey authentication working with ssh/sftp, how to have dar using too this public key authentication for sftp?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	The answer is as simply as adding the following option while calling dar: <code><b>-afile-auth</b></code>
      </p>
      <p>
	Why not doing pubkey by default and falling back to password authentication?
      </p>
      <p>
	First this is by choice, because -afile-auth also uses ~/.netrc even
	when using sftp. Second it could be possible to first try public key
	authentication and falling back to password authentication, but it
	would require libdar to first connect, eventually failing if pubkey was
	not provisionned or wrong then connecting again asking user for
	password on command line. I seems more efficient doing else: file authentication
	when user ask to to so, password authentication else.
	The counterpart is not huge for user (you can add -afile-auth in your
	~/.darrc and forget about it).
      </p>

      <a name="libssh2"><b>I Cannot get dar to connect to remote server using SFTP, it fails with <code>SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK</code></b></a><br/>

      <p>
	This may be due to several well known reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>dar/libdar cannot find the known_hosts file</li>
	<li>if using key authentifcation instead of password, dar/libdar cannot find the private key file</li>
	<li>if using key authentifcation instead of password, dar/libdar cannot find the public key file</li>
	<li>You have an outdate version of libssh2 or libcurl library and lack support for <i>ecdsa</i> host keys</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	<u>How to workaround?</u>
      <p>
      <p>
	For the <b>three first cases</b>, you can make use of environment variable to change the default behavior:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	DAR_SFTP_KNOWNHOSTS_FILE
	DAR_SFTP_PUBLIC_KEYFILE
	DAR_SFTP_PRIVATE_KEYFILE
      </code>
      <p>
	They respectively default to:
      </p>
      <code class=block>
	$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
	$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
      </code>
      <p>
	Changing them accordingly to your need is done before running dar from the shell, for example
	if you use sh or bash:
      </p>

      <code class=block>
	export DAR_SFTP_KNOWNHOSTS_FILE=~/.ssh/known_hosts_alternative
	# then use dar as expected
	dar -c sftp://....
	dar -t sftp://...
      </code>

      <p>
	if you use csh or tcsh:
      </p>

      <code class=block>
	setenv DAR_SFTP_KNOWNHOSTS_FILE ~/.ssh/known_hosts_alternative
	# then use dar as expected
	dar -c sftp://...
	dar -t sftp://...
      </code>

      <p>
	For the fourth and <b>last case</b>, the thing is more tricky:
      </p>
      <p>
	First, if you don't already know what the known_hosts file is used for:
      </p>
      <dl>
	<dd>
	  <i>
	    It is used by ssh/sftp to
	    validate that the host you connect to is not a pirate host trying to
	    put itself between you and the real sftp/ssh server you intend to
	    connect to. Usually the first time you connect to an sftp/ssh server
	    you need to validate the fingerprint of the key received from the server
	    (checking by another mean like phone call to the server's admin, https
	    web browsing to the server page, and so on). When you validate the host
	    key the first time, this adds a new line in known_hosts file in order
	    for ssh/sftp client to automatically check the next time you connect
	    that the host is still the correct one.
	  </i>
	</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
	The known_hosts file is usually located in your home directory at
	<code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> and looks like this:
      </p>

      <code class=block>
	asteroide.lan <b>ecdsa-sha2-nistp256</b> AAAAE2V...
	esxi,192.168.5.20 <b>ssh-rsa </b>AAAAB3N...
	192.168.6.253 <b>ssh-rsa</b> AAAAB3N...
      </code>

      <p>
	Each line concerns a different sftp/ssh server and contains three fields
	<dl>
	  <dt class=void><code>&lt;hostame or IP&gt;</code></dt><dd>
	    this is the server we have already connected to
	  </dd>
	  <dt class=void><code>&lt;host-key type&gt;</code></dt><dd>
	    this is the type of key
	  </dd>
	  <dt class=void><code>&lt;key&gt;</code></dt><dd>
	    this is the public key the server has sent the first time we connected
	  </dd>
	</dl>
      <p>
	We will focus on the second field.
      </p>
      <p>
	dar/libdar relies on <i>libcurl</i> for networking protocol interaction, which
	in turn relies on <i>libssh2</i>. Before <i>libssh2</i> 1.9.0 only <i>rsa</i>
	host key were supported leading to this message as soon as the <i>known_hosts</i>
	file contained a non-rsa host key (even another host listed in the <i>known_hosts</i>
	file than the one we tend to connect).
	As of December 2020, if 1.9.0 has now support for addition host key types (<i>ecdsa</i> and
	<i>ed25519</i>) libcurl does not yet leverage this support and the problem persists.
	I'm confident that things will be updated soon for this problem to be solved in a few months.
      </p>
      <p>
	In the meantime, several options are available to workaround that limitation:
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  disable known_hosts checking, by setting the environment
	  variable <code>DAR_SFTP_KNOWNHOSTS_FILE</code> to an empty string. Libdar will then
	  not ask libcurl/libssh2 to check for known hosts validity,
	  <b>but this is not a recommend option!</b>
	  because it opens the door to man-in-the-middle attacks.
	</li>
	<li>
	  copy the known_host file to <code>~/.ssh/known_host_for_libssh2</code>
	  and remove from this copy all the lines corresponding to host keys that are
	  not supported by libssh2, then set the <code>DAR_SFTP_KNOWNHOSTS_FILE</code>
	  variable to that new file. This workaround is OK only if the non
	  supported host key are not the one you intend to have dar communcating
	  with...
	</li>
	<li>
	  replace the the host key of the ssh/sftp server by an
	  ssh-rsa one, OK, this will most probably imply you to have root
	  permission on the remote ssh/sftp server... which is not possible when
	  using public cloud service over Internet.
	</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
	If you read "infinint" and see the above error message from dar, thanks to
	<a href="index.html#reporting_a_bug">report a bug</a> this should never occur.
	Else the problem appear when
	using dar before release 2.5.13 either at backup creation time when
	dar met a file with a negative date, or at backup reading time,
	reading a backup generated by dar 2.4.x or older and containing a
	file with a very distant date in the future thing dar 2.4.x and below
	recorded when the system returned a negative date for a file to save.
      </p>
      <p>
	What is a negative date? Date of files are recorded un "unix" time,
	that's to say the number of second elapsed since the beginning of year
	1970. A negative date is means a date before 1970, which should
	normally not be met today because the few computer that existed at that
	time had not such way of storing dates nor the same files and
	filesystems.
      </p>
      <p>
	However for some reasons such negative dates can be set returned by
	several operating systems (Linux based ones among others) and dar today
	has not the ability to record such dates (but if you need dar storing
	negative dates for a good reason please fill a
	<a href="index.html#Asking_for_a_new_feature">feature request</a> with the
	reason you need this feature).
      </p>
      <p>
	Since release 2.5.13 when dar the system reports a negative date for a
	file to save, dar asks the user to consider the date was zero, this
	requires user interaction and may not fit all needs. For that reason,
	the -az option has been added to automatically assume negative dates
	read from filesystem to be equal to zero (January 1st 1970, 00:00 GMT)
	without user interaction.

      <a name="full-from-diff"><b>I have a diff/incremental backup and I want to convert it to a full backup, how to do that?</b></a><br/>

      <p>
	it is possible to convert a differential backup if you also have the full
	backup is has been based on, in other words: the backup of reference.
	This is pretty simple to do:
      </p>

      <code class=block>
	dar -+ new_full_backup -A backup_of_reference -@ differential_backup full-from-diff [other options]
      </code>

      <dl>
	<dt class=void><b>new_full_backup</b></dt><dd>
	  is a backup that will be created according the provided other options
	  (compression, encryption, slicing, hashing and so on as specified on arguments).
	</dd>
	<dt class=void><b>backup_of_reference</b></dt><dd>
	  is the full backup that was used as reference for the differential backup
	</dd>
	<dt class=void><b>differential_backup</b></dt><dd>
	  is the differential backup you want to convert into a full backup
	</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
	the important point is the last argument <code>"full-from-diff"</code> which is defined in
	/etc/darrc and makes the merging operation used here (-+ option) working as expected for
	the resulting backup be the same as if a full backup had been done instead of a differential
	backup at the time "differential_backup" was created.
      </p>
      <p>
	For incremental backups, (backup which reference is not a full backup) you can also use
	this method but you first need to create the full backup from the incremental/differential
	backup that has been used as reference for this incremental backup. Thus the process should
	follow the same order used to create backups.
