Here are presented the various command-line option for the configure script.
For an exhaustive list use:

        ./configure --help

General Options:

        --prefix=<path>    which allows you to define where dar program will
                           be installed (/usr/local by default)
        --disable-static   do not build static library (activated by default)
        --disable-shared   do not build dynamic library (activated by default)

Dar specific options:
They take the form of --enable-xxx or --disable-xxx where xxx is the name of
the feature. Some features need an argument, which must be provided this way:

        --enable-os-bits=32

some features are activated by default, thus the --enable-xxx form is useless,
the --disable-xxx has to be used instead to overcome the default settings.

to simplify the document each option will be referred by a letter, those
preceded by a 'x' are activated by default:

x A ...... largefile
  B ...... ea-support
x C ...... nodump-flag
  D ...... examples
  E ...... os-bits
x F ...... dar-static
  G ...... mode
x H ...... special-alloc
  I ...... debug
  J ...... pedantic
  K ...... build-usage
  L ...... test-memory
x M ...... upx
x N ...... gnugetopt

I, J, K and L are debugging options and should not be set for normal use.

A : if set and if the system allows it, dar will be able to handle file of
    size larger than 4GB
B : if set, makes dar ready to save and restore Extended Attributes
    (see doc/NOTES paragraphs I and V)
C : if set, makes dar able to take care of the nodump-flag
    (activates the dar's --nodump option)
D : if set, example program based on infinint are also built
E : if set, dar uses the given argument (32 or 64) to determine which integer
    type to use. This much match your CPU register size. By default dar uses
    the system stdint.h file to determine the correct integer type to use
F : if set, builds dar_static binary (statically linked version of dar)
G : if set, replace infinint by 32 or 64 bits integers. This makes a faster
    executable and less fond of memory, but with several restrictions (about
    for example ability to handle large files, or high dates. See
    doc/LIMITATIONS for more),
H : if set, use special memory allocation, adapted when a lot of little piece
    of memory are allocated (improves dar's executable speed)
I : if set, use debug compilation option, and if possible statically link
    binaries
J : if set, transmits the -pedantic option to the compiler
K : if set, rebuild usage files (requires libxml2)
L : if set, wrap memory allocation routine to track memory leakage (makes a
    very slow executable)
M : if set, look for UPX command, and if found compresses library and executables,
    if no upx is found, does the same as if the option is not given.
N : if set (default), looks for libgnugetopt and use the gnu getopt_long()
    call.


For version 2.1.x (N option in 2.1.2 appeared to fix a bug)
-----------------------------
legend: ! = option available for that system
        . = option Not available for that system
(free inspiration from the Cisco ping command output)

 System \ option   |  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N
enabled by default:|  x   x     x   x         x x
---------------------------------------------------
Linux              |  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! long options supported
Solaris 8          |  ! . . ! ! . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! long options supported with libgnugetopt
FreeBSD            |  ! . . ! ! . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! long options supported with libgnugetopt
Cygwin             |  ! . . ! ! . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! long options supported
NetBSD             |  ! . . ! ! . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! long options supported with libgnugetopt

Consequences:

For Linux
----------
All option available

        ./configure [...]


For Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Cygwin,
---------------
configure will detect that two options cannot be activated (C and F) and
thus will just show a warning. On theses system,

        ./configure [...]
is equivalent to
        ./configure --disable-nodump-flag --disable-dar-static [...]
both work the same.

if libgnugetopt library is present and the include file <getopt.h> is also available
configure will use this library to link against long options will be available in
resulting dar executable.
