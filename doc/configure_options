Here are presented the various command-line option for the configure script.
For an exhaustive list of options use:

        ./configure --help

General Options:
-----------------

        --prefix=<path>    which allows you to define where dar program will
                           be installed (/usr/local by default)
        --disable-static   do not build static library (activated by default)
        --disable-shared   do not build dynamic library (activated by default)

Dar specific options (see details in next paragraph):
----------------------

optimization options:
  --enable-mode

deactivation options:
  --disable-largefile
  --disable-ea-support
  --disable-nodump-flag
  --disable-dar-static
  --disable-special-alloc
  --disable-upx
  --disable-gnugetopt
  --disable-libdl-test
  --disable-thread-safe
  --disable-libz-linking
  --disable-libbz2-linking
  --disable-libcrypto-linking
  --disable-build-html

troobleshooting options:
  --enable-os-bits

debugging options:
  --enable-examples
  --enable-debug
  --enable-pedantic
  --enable-build-usage
  --enable-test-memory
  --enable-profiling

Description
--------------

  --enable-mode=32 or --enable-mode=64
    if set, replace infinint by 32 or 64 bits integers. This makes a faster
    executable and less fond of memory, but with several restrictions (about
    for example ability to handle large files, or high dates. See
    doc/LIMITATIONS for more)


  --disable-largefile
    whatever your system is, dar will be able to handle file of
    size larger than 4GB

  --disable-ea-support
    whatever your system is, dar will not be able to save or restore
    Extended Attributes (see doc/NOTES paragraphs I and V)

  --disable-nodump-flag
    whatever your system is, dar will not be able to take care of the
    nodump-flag (thanks to the --nodump option)

  --disable-dar-static
    dar_static binary (statically linked version of dar) will not be built

  --disable-special-alloc
    dar uses a special allocation scheme by default (gather the many small
    allocations in big fewer ones), this improves dar's execution speed

  --disable-upx
    if upx is found in the PATH, binary are upx compressed at installation
    step. This can be disabled by this option.

  --disable-gnugetopt
    on non GNU systems (Solaris, etc.) configure looks for libgnugetopt
    to have the long options support thanks to the gnu getopt_long() call,
    this can be disabled.

  --disable-libdl-test
    some system lack statically linked library (like libdl), which forbids
    building dar_static. If configure fails building a statically linked binary
    that relies on libdl, it disabled dar_static. You can disable this security
    check, but don't complain if you get error messages at compilation time.

  --disable-thread-safe
    libdar may need POSIX mutex to be thread safe. If you don't wan't libdar
    relaying on POSIX mutex even if they are available, use this option.
    The resulting library may not be thread safe. It will always be thread
    safe if you use --disable-special-alloc, and it will never be thread safe
    if --enable-test-memory is used.

  --disable-libz-linking
    disable linking to libz, thus -z option (gzip compression) will not
    be available

  --disable-libbz2-linking
    disable linking to libbz2, thus -z option (libbz2 compression)
    will not be available

  --disable-libcrypto-linking
    disable linking with openssl's libcrypto library. Strong encryption
    will not be available

  --enable-os-bits=32 or --enable-os-bits=64
    if set, dar uses the given argument (32 or 64) to determine which integer
    type to use. This much match your CPU register size. By default dar uses
    the system <stdint.h> file to determine the correct integer type to use


  --enable-examples
    if set, example program based on infinint are also built

  --enable-debug
    if set, use debug compilation option, and if possible statically link
    binaries

  --enable-pedantic
    if set, transmits the -pedantic option to the compiler

  --enable-build-usage
    if set, rebuild usage files (requires libxml2)

  --enable-test-memory
    if set, wrap memory allocation routine to track memory leakage (makes a
    very slow executable)

  --disable-build-html
    don't built the HTML programming documentation (under/doc/html). This is usually
    done if doxygen is available.

  --enable-profiling
    enable executable profiling
