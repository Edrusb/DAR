<blockquote>
<p>We all should make backups of our important data. This omnipresent
advice is usually ignored by most people. I ignored it too,
until I lost a good deal of important data. Not happy enough,
I managed to continue loosing data in a few posterior incidents,
until I decided that it was enough. Then I browsed <a class="reference" href="http://freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</a>
for backup solutions allowing differential backup and found <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a>.</p>
<p>A complete backup means that all the files falling under your
backup policy will be saved. A differential or incremental backup
will contain only the files whose contents have changed since
the previous backup, either full or differential.</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> allows you to create easily a set of differential
backups. The solution I've developed helps me have an automatic
backup solution which runs every night. The first day of the
month, a full backup is made. The rest of the month, only
differential backups are made. In my situation, very few files
change from day to day, sometimes the source code of the project
I'm hacking on, and always my mailboxes.</p>
<p>The result is that I can restore the contents of my computer to a
specific day with ease, if I ever need to. <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> is a command line
program, and it can get slightly complex with a few options.
This little mini-howto will explain my custom solution, which
is very crude, but works fine for me. Yes, I've actually tested
restoring the data from the backup. In fact, during the end of
the year 2003 I moved to another country and I took just one
CD ROM with me plus a bootable <a class="reference" href="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</a>, and I recovered the exact
state of my Debian installation in a few hours. No customizing,
no long installations, no missing files.</p>
<p>This document was written using version 1.3.0 of <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a>. When
I updated to DAR 2.0.3, everything kept working, I didn't
even have to update my backup archives.  So it looks like the
interface and backup format are pretty stable, or at least
backwards compatible. However, don't take everything said here
for granted.  Verify that the version of <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> you have installed
works as expected and you can restore from the generated backup
before you have to rely on it.</p>
<p>This version of the text uses reStructuredText (that's
what the weird markup in the text version is for). See
<a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">http://docutils.sourceforge.net/</a> for more information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> is very similar to <a class="reference" href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/tar/">tar</a> in the number of options it has:
there's plenty for every need, but way too much for beginners to
handle. As usual, you can always get help from the program typing
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dar</span> <span class="pre">-h</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">man</span> <span class="pre">dar</span></tt> after you have installed it. Like <a class="reference" href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/tar/">tar</a>,
there's a set of mandatory switches which define the type of
operation you are doing (create, extract, list, etc), and a set
of switches which affect the selected option. Just for the sake
of it, imagine that you want to backup one folder of your home
directory. You would write something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dar -c backup_file_without_extension file1 file2 ... fileN
</pre>
<p>The output should be similar to the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ dar -c my_backup_file safecopy.py/ translate_chars.py/


 --------------------------------------------
 15 inode(s) saved
 with 0 hard link(s) recorded
 0 inode(s) not saved (no file change)
 0 inode(s) failed to save (filesystem error)
 4 files(s) ignored (excluded by filters)
 0 files(s) recorded as deleted from reference backup
 --------------------------------------------
 Total number of file considered: 19
$ ls
mailbox_date_trimmer/  my_backup_file.1.dar  sdb.py/
mailbox_reader/        safecopy.py/          translate_chars.py/
</pre>
<p>As you will notice, <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> will add a number and extension to your
name. The purpose of the extension is clear, it helps to know
visually that the file is a <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> backup. The number is called
a <em>slice</em>, and this is related to <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a>'s built-in feature of
splitting a backup over several media. If for example you wanted
to make a backup to CD ROM, but your directories are bigger
than the capacity of one CD ROM, you can tell <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> to split the
archive across as many files as needed, which you can later burn
to several units.</p>
<p>Would you like to recover that backup? Pretty easy, type the
following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ mkdir temp
$ cd temp
$ dar -x ../my_backup_file
file ownership will not be restored as dar is not run as root.
to avoid this message use -O option [return = OK | esc = cancel]
Continuing...


 --------------------------------------------
 15 file(s) restored
 0 file(s) not restored (not saved in archive)
 0 file(s) ignored (excluded by filters)
 0 file(s) less recent than the one on filesystem
 0 file(s) failed to restore (filesystem error)
 0 file(s) deleted
 --------------------------------------------
 Total number of file considered: 15

<div class="section" id="the-backup-strategy">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" name="the-backup-strategy">The backup strategy</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step to create a good backup is to determine what parts
of your system need one.  This doesn't necessarily mean that you
can't create a full backup, but most likely splitting it in at
least two parts is going to help <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> (or any backup tool) a lot.</p>
<p>My home system consists of two hard disks. The first hard disk is
split into a 3.8 GB partition where my complete system lives, and
another partition of 11 GB where all my music and other temporary
files are stored, like a local Debian package repository I make
for myself. The second hard disk has a 9.4 GB partition and
its only purpose is to serve as backup of the primary disk. I
have no interest in backing up my music, because I have all the
original CDs lying around and have scripts to re-ogg them.</p>
<p>From the 3.8 GB I want to backup, usually between 1.3 and 1.5 GB
are always empty.  I will split logically the used 2.3 GB into
<em>system</em> and <em>home directories</em> (at the moment of writing this
my home is 588 MB). The reason for this split is that as a normal
user, I can only change my home directory and other files from
the partitions I won't be backing up. Meanwhile the <em>system</em>
part of the partition remains pretty stable and unmodified
because I rarely (un)install software. In fact, from my <em>home</em>
directory the only things changing usually will be my <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Mail</span></tt>
folder and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projects</span></tt>, where I put documents like this one
and other software I write/hack.</p>
<p>The basic distinction between <em>home directories</em> and <em>system</em>
can be useful in organizations too. If you work for a university,
usually all machines will have the same system configuration
but depending on the machine their homes will have different
data. You can make a <em>system backup</em> of a single machine, and
<em>home backups</em> of each computer. Another common configuration is
having a centralized server which exports home directories with
NFS. Here you only have to backup the server. If you have users
with high privileges, leave them the task of doing the <em>system
backup</em> of their own machines, the exported home is something
they can ignore because it will be done at the server machine.</p>
<p>Once you've decided what to backup, you want to decide how
to configure <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> for the backups. You can use switches or
configuration files. Switches are OK when you don't have many
options. Configuration files are better when you want to make
different complex inclusion/exclusion rules of what files you want
to backup, and more importantly, you can use comments to document
the switch, stating for example the reason why you included this
or that directory. This can be useful if you come back several
months later and you wonder why all those options are there.</p>
<p>For my setup, I'll be running the <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> commands inside shell
scripts called periodically by cron (<a class="reference" href="#setting-up-some-scripts-to-automate-the-process">Setting up some scripts
to automate the process</a>), so I don't mind having long command
lines, and this very same document serves for the purpose of
documenting the scripts. If you prefer configuration files,
read <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a>'s documentation to find out how to use them and the
format they use.</p>

<p>Here is the full command line I'll be using for my <em>system</em>

<dd><p class="first last"><a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> can compress your backup. The compression is applied
to individual files, and it can be bad for small files. By
default files with 100 bytes or less won't be compressed.
With the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></tt> switch I increase this to 256, which seems to
work better for all those little configuration files lying
under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home</span></tt>. As you see this is a totally
optional switch, basically for tuning freaks like me.</p>

<li><dl class="first docutils">

<dd><p class="first last">This option activates <a class="reference" href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/">Bzip2</a> archive compression, which

compression level, which goes from 0 (no compression) to 9
(best compression, slow processing). <a class="reference" href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/">Bzip2</a> by default uses 6,
which is the best speed/compression ratio for most files. I
don't specify compression level, 6 is fine for me.</p>

Megabytes is the maximum file size <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> will create. If your
backup is bigger, you will end up with different backup files
each with a slice number before the file extension, so you
can save each file to a different unit of your backup media
(floppies, zip, CDROM, etc). My backups are much smaller
than this size, and I keep this switch just to be safe if I
happen to create a big file in my home directory and forget
to delete it. If this switch is useful for you, check <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a>'s

to create a backup archive. For those who don't understand
what follows, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`date</span> <span class="pre">-I`</span></tt> is the shell's back tick
expansion. In short, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">date</span> <span class="pre">-I</span></tt> will provide a date as
YYYY-MM-DD format. With back ticks and used as a parameter,
the output of the command will be used as a string of the
parent command. This way you can create backup archives with
the creation date embedded in the name. If you still don't
understand what I'm talking about, try to run the following
from the command line:</p>
<pre class="last literal-block">

are a few more, but they are for testing/system purpose),
system directories which aren't really physical files like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">proc</span></tt>, other drives you may have mounted under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mnt</span></tt>

<p>That wasn't so hard. Check <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a>'s manual page for more useful
switches you might want to use. And here's the command line I'll
be running as a plain user inside my home directory:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

   -P instalacion_manual -P Mail/mail_pa_leer
</pre>
<p>Nothing new under the sun. As you see, most of the command line
is identical to the other one, I only change the name of the
directories I want to exclude with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-P</span></tt> and the root directory
with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-R</span></tt> switch.</p>

their dates, their compressed size, etc. You can extract the
<em>catalogue</em> and store it separately. Why would you want to do
this? To set up networked differential backups.</p>
<p>In order to create a differential backup, you need to provide the
previous backup so <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> can decide which files have changed or
not. Doing this can be expensive in bandwidth if you work with a
network. Instead, after you create a backup, you can extract the
<em>catalogue</em> and send it to the machine doing the backups. Next
time, you can use this file with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-A</span></tt> switch, and it will
all work as if the complete file was there.</p>
<p>This can be also useful if you use slices, because the <em>catalogue</em>
is created from the first and last slice. It's more comfortable
to pass a single file to the backup command rather than having
to carry the disks of your previous backup with you.</p>

<p>As said before, now it's the time to put our backup solution
under cron.  Place the following executable script for <em>system</em>
backup under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/root/dar_backup.sh</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh

DIR=/oldg/backup
FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_data
# Commands
/usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R / -c $FILE -Z &quot;*.gz&quot; \
   -Z &quot;*.bz2&quot; -Z &quot;*.zip&quot; -Z &quot;*.png&quot; -P home/gregorio -P tmp \
   -P mnt -P dev/pts -P proc -P floppy -P burner \
   -P cdrom &gt; /dev/null
/usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE &gt; /dev/null
/usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chown .gregorio \{\} \;
/usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 440 \{\} \;
</pre>
<p>Some things to notice:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>DIR is the variable which holds the destination directory.</li>
<li>FILE will hold the path to today's backup file.</li>
<li>I use full paths for the commands because my root account
doesn't have all of them included in the default
environment. This is potentially a security risk. Ideally you
would like to compile <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> as root and keep your binaries where
you make them so nobody can touch them. And run <a class="reference" href="http://www.tripwire.org/">Tripwire</a> over
them too.</li>
<li><a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> generates statistics after each run. We don't want them
in our cron because it will generate unnecessary mail. Only
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdout</span></tt> is redirected to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/dev/null</span></tt>. Errors will be
reported and a mail generated if something goes wrong.</li>
<li>The last two <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find</span></tt> commands are optional. I use them to
change file ownership to a normal user, which will later create
the backup.  Again, another security risk. root should backup
that from root, and users should backup their stuff. But with
a mono user system, I don't care. If some intruder is good
enough to go through my firewall and account passwords to take
a look at my backups, I'm already screwed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now place the following nearly identical script for differential
backups under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/root/dar_diff.sh</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh

DIR=/oldg/backup
FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_diff
PREV=`/bin/ls $DIR/*.dar|/usr/bin/tail -n 1|/usr/bin/awk -F '.' '{print $1;}'`
/usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R / -c $FILE -Z &quot;*.gz&quot; \
   -Z &quot;*.bz2&quot; -Z &quot;*.zip&quot; -Z &quot;*.png&quot; -P home/gregorio -P tmp -P mnt \
   -P dev/pts -P proc -P floppy -P burner -P cdrom -A $PREV &gt; /dev/null
/usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE &gt; /dev/null
/usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chown .gregorio \{\} \;
/usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 440 \{\} \;
</pre>
<p>The only two changes are the addition of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-A</span></tt> switch and
the generation of the PREV variable with a complicated command
line. Let's see what this command line does:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt> command creates a list of the files with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.dar</span></tt> extension in the backup directory. This output is
piped to the next command.</li>
<li>By default <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></tt> displays files alphabetically. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tail</span></tt>
is used to get the last file with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-n</span> <span class="pre">1</span></tt> switch, which
says to display only the last line. Again, the last filename
is piped to the next command.</li>
<li><a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> wants to operate on filenames without slice number and
extension. This means that if we don't get rid of the tail,
<a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> will stop the operation and ask an interactive question to
the user, defeating the purpose of automation. We separate the
complete filename with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">awk</span></tt>. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">awk</span></tt> command separates
the string at the dots, and prints the first column. The result
is the base name we want to pass <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We only have to put these two scripts under cron control. This
is what we have to type after <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">crontab</span> <span class="pre">-e</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
15 0 2-31 * * ./dar_diff.sh
15 0 1    * * ./dar_backup.sh
</pre>
<p>Look up in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">man</span> <span class="pre">-S</span> <span class="pre">5</span> <span class="pre">crontab</span></tt> the syntax of the command. In
short, those two lines tell cron to run the scripts 15 minutes
past midnight. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dar_backup.sh</span></tt> will be run only the first day
of the month. The other script will be run all the other days.</p>
<p>Here are the backup scripts for your users. They are the same,
changing only switches to the <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> command and paths:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh
# dar_backup.sh

DIR=/oldg/backup_gregorio
FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_data
# Commands
/usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R /home/gregorio -c $FILE \
   -Z &quot;*.gz&quot; -Z &quot;*.bz2&quot; -Z &quot;*.zip&quot; -Z &quot;*.png&quot; \
   -P instalacion_manual -P Mail/mail_pa_leer &gt; /dev/null
/usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE &gt; /dev/null
/usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 400 \{\} \;

#!/bin/sh
# dar_diff.sh

DIR=/oldg/backup_gregorio
FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_diff
PREV=`/bin/ls $DIR/*.dar|/usr/bin/tail -n 1|/usr/bin/awk -F '.' '{print $1;}'`
/usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R /home/gregorio -c $FILE \
   -Z &quot;*.gz&quot; -Z &quot;*.bz2&quot; -Z &quot;*.zip&quot; -Z &quot;*.zip&quot; \
   -P instalacion_manual -P Mail/mail_pa_leer -A $PREV &gt; /dev/null
/usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE &gt; /dev/null
/usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 400 \{\} \;
</pre>
<p>Don't forget to add the required crontab entries for your user
pointing to the appropriate path.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the time comes to restore your backup, depending on what you
saved you will have a full backup of one month plus differential
backups up to the last time you managed to make. The restoration
process is very simple, it's the same as described on the first
chapter (<a class="reference" href="#simple-dar-usage">Simple DAR usage</a>), only you have to do it first for
the full backup, and then for the differential ones.  This can
be boring, so here's another shell script you can save with your
backup files:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh

if [ -n &quot;$3&quot; ]; then
   CMD=&quot;$1&quot;
   INPUT=&quot;$2_data&quot;
   FS_ROOT=&quot;$3&quot;
   $CMD -x &quot;$INPUT&quot; -w -R &quot;$FS_ROOT&quot;
   for file in ${INPUT:0:8}*_diff*; do
      $CMD -x &quot;${file:0:15}&quot; -w -R &quot;$FS_ROOT&quot;
   done
   echo &quot;All done.&quot;
else
   echo &quot;Not enough parameters.

Usage: script dar_location base_full_backup directory

Where dar_location is a path to a working dar binary, base_full_backup
is a date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', and directory is the place where
you want to put the restored data, usually '/' when run as root.&quot;
fi
</pre>
<p>The script is pretty self explicative. The only things you
would care is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-w</span></tt> switch, which tells <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> to overwrite
found files. This is necessary for differential backups. Oh,
and place the script in the same directory where you put your
backup files. Here's an usage example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./recover.sh /usr/local/bin/dar 2003-10-01 /tmp/temp_path/
</pre>
<p>Try to run that as a normal user with a few of your backup
files. You can put the result in a temporary directory, so the
nice thing is you don't have to wipe your hard disk to test it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Denis Corbin suggests that the scripts creating the backups could
verify the exit status of the <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> command. For the purpose of
these very simple scripts this is not critical because <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a>
itself will bail out with an error message, and cron will
report any output through mail (something which doesn't happen
if everything goes right).</p>
<p>However, testing the exit status can be useful if you are testing
the scripts interactively and want to know which commands are
executed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh

DIR=/oldg/backup
FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_data
# Commands
if /usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R / -c $FILE -Z &quot;*.gz&quot; \
      -Z &quot;*.bz2&quot; -Z &quot;*.zip&quot; -Z &quot;*.png&quot; -P home/gregorio -P tmp \
      -P mnt -P dev/pts -P proc -P floppy -P burner \
      -P cdrom &gt; /dev/null ; then
   if /usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE &gt; /dev/null ; then
      echo &quot;Archive created and successfully tested.&quot;
   else
      echo &quot;Archive created but test FAILED.&quot;
   fi
else
   echo &quot;Archive creating FAILED.&quot;
fi
/usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chown .gregorio \{\} \;
/usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 440 \{\} \;
</pre>
<p>You can test this version easily running the script and killing
the <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> process from another terminal or console with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">killall</span>
<span class="pre">dar</span></tt>. That will force the termination of the <a class="reference" href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> process and
you will see that one of the failure branches is reached in the
backup script.</p>
<p>Another possible use of testing the status code could be to
remove incomplete archives from the hard disk if something
went wrong, trigger additional external commands when something
fails, or avoid testing the created archive when you know that
the first command already failed. The latter can be done easily
concatenating both the creation and testing commands with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span></tt>
in a single line. That will tell the shell to run both commands
as a sequence and avoid running the second if the first failed.</p>
<p>However, if a power failure happens in the middle of a backup,
this version of the script would still leave dangling invalid
archives. To prevent this you could enhance the script to do
a <em>positive verification</em>. This means creating the backup in
a temporary directory along with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.valid</span></tt> file if the
successful branch of the script is reached.</p>
<p>With this strategy, another cron script monitoring the directory
where the temporary backups are placed would move to the final
backup directory those archives which have a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.valid</span></tt> file,
deleting all other whose last modification timestamp is older
than one hour.</p>

<p>I'm not going to implement these soon, because I'm very lazy,
but if you are one of those hyperactive hackers, here are some
things which would be nice:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unify both the main and differential scripts into a single one,
so if the script is run and there is no main backup for the
current month, the main backup will be created. Useful if
your machine happens to be down during the time the monthly
backup is done.</li>
<li>Upgrade the scripts to generate daily a CDROM image with
<a class="reference" href="http://www.fokus.fhg.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html">cdrecord</a> and burn it automatically to a rewritable disc
placed in your machine. So if your whole hard disk is trashed,
you still have the last backup on removable media. Of course,
this is limited and cannot be automated if your backup spans
more than one CDROM. Do the same for ZIP/JAZZ/whatever you have.</li>
<li>Integration of generated backups with a mini <a class="reference" href="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</a> bootable
distribution. Or any other floppy distribution which can be
booted from CDROM. So you have a recovery CDROM with tools to
format your hard disk, and near it you have a fresh backup to
restore a working machine.</li>
<li>Synchronisation of backup directories through Internet with
remote hosts. Even if the whole machine is burnt physically
along with your house, you have up to date backups somewhere
else. Could be done easily with programs like <a class="reference" href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> through
<a class="reference" href="http://www.openssh.com/">ssh</a> running in a cron job.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, clever people out there have already started making
such scripts for themselves and are not afraid to share them. To
avoid cluttering this mini-howto I'm going to store them <em>as-is</em>
at my web page:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>Feel free to send me your own improvement and I'll add it to
the directory. Whether you are sending a single script file
or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.tar.gz</span></tt> with a whole backup suite, please add a simple
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.txt</span></tt> file which I'll put near the file, so people can read
