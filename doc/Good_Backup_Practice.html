      </h2>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">This short guide is here to
gather important (and somehow obvious)
techniques about computer backups. It also explains the risks you take
not following these principles. I thought this was obvious and well
known by anyone, up to recently when I started getting feedback of
people complaining about their lost data because of bad media or other
reasons. To the question "have you tested your archive?", I was
surprised to get the negative answers.
      <p>This guide is not especially linked to dar no more than to any
other tool, thus, you can take advantage of reading this document if
you are not sure of your backup procedure, whatever is the backup
software you use.</p>
      </div>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Notions</h2>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> In the following we will speak
about backup and archive: </div>
      <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>by backup, is meant a copy of some data that remains in
place in an operational system</li>
        <li>by
archive, is meant a copy of data that is removed afterward from an
operational system. It stays available but is no more used frequently.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> With the previous meaning of
an archive you can also make a backup of an archive (for example a
clone copy of your archive). </div>
      <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Archives</h2>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">1.</span> The
first think to do just after making an archive is testing it on its
definitive medium. </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> There are several reasons that
make this testing important:<br>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>any medium may have a surface error, which in some case
cannot be detected at writing time.</li>
        <li>the software you use may have bugs (also dar can, yes. ;-)
... ).</li>
        <li>you
may have done a wrong operation or missed an error message (no space
left to write the whole archive ad so on), especially when using poorly
written scripts.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> Of
course the archive testing must be done when the backup has been put on
its definitive place (CD-R, floppy, tape, etc.), if you have to move it
(copy to another media), then you need to test it again on the new
medium. The testing operation, must read/test all the data, not just
list the archive contents (-t option instead of -l option for dar). And
of course the archive must have a minimum mechanism to detect errors
(dar has one without compression, and two when using compression). </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">2.</span>
As a replacement for testing, a better operation is to compare the
files in the archive with those on the original files on the disk (-d
option for dar). This makes the same as testing archive readability and
coherence, while also checking that the data is really identical
whatever the corruption detection<br>
mechanisms used are. This
operation is not suited for a set of data that changes (like a active
system backup), but is probably what you need when creating an archive.
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">3.</span>
Increasing the degree of security, the next thing to try is to restore
the archive in a temporary place or better on another computer. This
will let you check that from end to end, you have a good usable backup,
on which you can rely. Once you have restored, you will need to compare
the result, the diff command can help you here, moreover, this is a
program that has no link with dar so it would be very improbable to
have a common bug to both dar and diff that let you think both original
and restored data are identical while they are not!</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">4.</span>
Unfortunately, many (all) media do alter with time, and an archive
that was properly written on a correct media may become unreadable with
time and/or bad environment conditions. Thus of course, take care not
to store magnetic storages near magnetic sources (like HiFi speakers)
or enclosed in metallic boxes, as well as avoid having sun directly
lighting your CD-R(W) DVD-R(W), etc. Also mentioned for many media is
humidity: respect the acceptable humidity range for each medium (don't
store your data in your bathroom, kitchen, cave, ...). Same thing about
the temperature. More generally have a look at the safe environmental
conditions described in the documentation, even just once for each
media type.</p>
      <p>The problem with archive is that usually you
need them for a long time, while the media has a limited lifetime. A
solution is to make one (or several) copy (i.e.: backup of archive) of
the data when the original support has arrived it half expected life.</p>
      <p>Another
solution, is to use <a href="http://parchive.sourceforge.net/">Parchive</a>,
it works in the principle of RAID disk
systems, creating beside each file a par file which can be used later
to recover missing part or corrupted part of the original file. Of
course, Parchive can work on dar's slices. But, it requires more
storage, thus you will have to choose smaller slice size to have place
to put Parchive data on your CD-R for example. The amount of data
generated by Parchive depends on the redundancy level (Parchive's -r
option). Check the NOTES file for more informations about using
Parchive with dar. When using read-only medium, you will need to copy
the corrupted file to a read-write medium for Parchive can repair it.
Unfortunately the usual 'cp' command will stop when the first I/O error
will be met, making you unavailable to get the sane data *after* the
corruption. In most case you will not have enough sane data for
Parchive to repair you file. For that reason "dar_cp" is a cp-like
command that skip over the corruptions and can copy sane data after the
corrupted part.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">5.</span>
another problem arrives when an archive is often read. The fact to
read, often degrades the media little by little, and makes the media's
lifetime shorter. A possible solution is to have two copies, one for
reading and one to keep as backup, copy which should be never read
except for making a new copy. Chances are that the often read copy will
"die" before the backup copy, you then could be able to make a new
backup copy from the original backup copy, which in turn could become
the new "often read" medium.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">6.</span>
Of course, if you want to have an often read archive and also want to
keep it forever, you could combine the two of the previous techniques,
making two copies, one for storage and one for backup. Once you have
spent a certain time (medium half lifetime for example), you could make
a new copy, and keep them beside the original backup copy in case of.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">7.</span>
Another problem, is safety of your data. In some case, the archive you
have does not need to be kept a very long time nor it needs to be read
often, but instead is very "precious". in that case a solution could be
to make several copies that you could store in very different
locations. This could prevent data lost in case of fire disaster, or
other cataclysms.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">8.</span>
Another aspect is the privacy of your data. An archive may not have to
be accessible to anyone. This aspect is a bit out of the scope of this
document, but several directions could be possible to answer this
problem:</p>
      </div>
      <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>Physical restriction to the access of the archive (stored
in a bank or locked place, for example)</li>
        <li>Hid the archive (in your garden ;-) ) or hide the data
among other data (Edgar Poe's hidden letter technique)</li>
        <li>Encrypting your archive</li>
        <li>And probably some other ways I forgot.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">For encryption, dar now
provides strong encryption inside the archive
(blowfish algorithm), it does preserve the direct access feature that
avoid you having to read the whole archive to restore just one file.
But you can also use an external encryption mechanism, like GnuPG to
encrypt slice by slice for example.
      <h2>Backup</h2>
Backups act a bit like an archive, except that
they are a copy of a changing set of data, which is moreover expected
to stay on the original location (the system).
      <p>The fact that the data is changing introduces two problems:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A backup is quite never up to date, and you will probably
loose data if you have to rely on them</li>
        <li>A backup becomes soon obsolete.</li>
      </ul>
The
backup has a also the role of keeping a recent history of changes. For
example, you may have deleted a precious data from your system. And it
is quite possible that you notice this mistake long ago after deletion.
In that case, a old backup stays useful, in spite of some more recent
backups.
      <p>In consequences, backup need to be done often for having a
minimum delta in case of crash disk. But, and new backup do not mean
that older can be removed. A usual way of doing that, is to have a set
of media, over which you rotate the backups. The new backup is done
over the oldest backup of the set. This way you keep a certain history
of your system changes. It is your choice to decide how much archive
you want to keep, and the frequency of your backups.</p>
      <p>A
point that can increase the history while saving media space required
by each backup is the differential backup. A differential backup is a
backup done only of what have changed since a previous backup (the
"backup of reference"). The drawback is that it is not autonomous and
cannot be used alone to restore a full system. Thus there is no problem
to keep the differential backup on the same media as the one where is
located the backup of reference.</p>
      <p>Doing a lot of consecutive
differential backup (taking the last backup as reference for the next
differential backup), will save your media space, but will cost time at
restoration in case of computer accident. You will have to restore the
full backup (of reference), then you will have to restore all the many
backup you have done up to the last. This implies that you must keep
all the differential backup you have done since the backup of
reference,if you wish to restore the exact state of the filesystem at
the time of the last differential backup.</p>
      <p>It is thus up to
you to decide how much differential backup you do, and how much often
you make a full backup. A common scheme, is to make a full backup once
a week and make differential backup each day of the week. The backup
done in a week are kept together. You could then have ten sets of
full+differential backups, and a new full backup would erase the oldest
full backup as well as its associated differential backups, this way
you keep ten week history of backup with a backup every day, but this
is just an example.</p>
      <p>An interesting protection suggested by
George Foot on the dar-support mailing-list: once you make a new full
backup, the idea is to make an additional differential backup based on
the previous full backup (the one just older than the one we have just
built) full backup, which would "acts as a substitute for the actual
full backup in case something does go wrong with it later on".</p>
