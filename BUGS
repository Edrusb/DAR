KNOWN BUGS:

#1: description: files pointed to by a symbolic links get their times
        (mtime & atime) not properly restored
	   
    problem: when restoring time of a symbolic link the utime() system call
	does not change the inode of the symbolic link itself but the one of 
	the file pointed to by the symbolic link

    solution: as the utime() call behaves the same on many Unix platforms,
	(HP-UX, solaris, Linux, etc.), the times for the symbolic links are
	no more restored, thus files pointed to by symbolic links are not 
	affected by the utime() strange behaviour. Dar, behaves not the 
	same as touch, tar, etc.

    affects version: 1.0.0
    fixed in version: 1.0.1


#2: description: dar immediately exits with message "file mode is neither
        read nor write" while creating an archive on 64 bits platforms.

    problem: missing mask with O_ACCMODE for flags returned by fcntl()
        system call

    solution: O_ACCMODE mask added

    affects versions: 1.0.0, 1.0.1
    fixed in version: 1.0.2

	
#3: description: making differential backup with some directory implicitly or 
        explicitly (-P) excluded, sometime lead to full backup. 

    problem: when entering a directory that was ignored, the comparison in the
        catalogue of reference was not going back to the parent directory,
	leading the comparison to be no more synchronised with the file being
	read.

    solution: added a line to go back to parent directory when treating an
        ignored directory

    affects versions: 1.0.0, 1.0.1
    fixed in version: 1.0.2


#4: description: on Linux 64 bits, when an interaction from the user is
	required, (escape or return key), the keys have to be pressed four
	time before dar can read a character.

    problem:
	unknown, same code works fine on other platforms, and if bad character
	remains in the pipe, the message would be displayed several time,
	which is not the case, here. It seems that the user has to press four
	key for	the first one to be accessible to dar.

    solution: none actually

    affects versions: 1.0.0, 1.0.1 , 1.0.2 and probably also 1.1.0
    fixed in version: none

#5: description: Dar stops one of the two following error:
   --- exception nature = [alive]  exception type = [BUG] ----------
   [source]
           file compressor.cpp line 244 : it seems to be a bug here
   [most outside call]
   -----------------------------------
	
       or
 
   --- exception nature = [alive]  exception type = [BUG] ----------
   [source]
           file compressor.cpp line 254 : it seems to be a bug here
   [most outside call]
   -----------------------------------

    problem:
	the zlib deflate() calls returned an unexpected value (Z_STREAM_END).
	and inflate() in some rare cases was called without data to process,
	when reaching end of file, which made inflate() to return Z_BUF_ERROR 
	code.

    solution:
	adding code for taking care of the returned code Z_STREAM_END by 
	deflate(), and code for taking care of Z_BUF_ERROR returned at end
 	of file.

    affects version: 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2
    fixed in version: 1.0.3
