KNOWN BUGS:

#1: Description: files pointed to by a symbolic links get their times
	 (mtime & atime) not properly restored
	   
     problem: when restoring time of a symbolic link the utime() system call
	does not change the inode of the symbolic link itself but the one of 
	the file pointed to by the symbolic link

     solution: as the utime() call behaves the same on many Unix platforms,
	(HP-UX, solaris, Linux, etc.), the times for the symbolic links are
	no more restored, thus files pointed to by symbolic links are not 
	affected by the utime() strange behaviour. Dar, behaves not the 
	same as touch, tar, etc.

     affects version: 1.0.0
     fixed in version: 1.0.1


#2: Description: dar immediately exits with message "file mode is neither read nor write"
        while creating an archive on 64 bits platforms.

     problem: missing mask with O_ACCMODE for flags returned by fcntl() system call

     solution: O_ACCMODE mask added

     affects versions: 1.0.0, 1.0.1
     fixed in version: 1.0.2

	
#3: Description: make differential backup with some directory implicitly or explicitly (-P) 
	excluded, sometime lead to full backup. 

     problem: when entering a directory that was ignored, the comparison in the catalogue of
	reference was not going back to the parent directory, leading the comparison to be
	no more synchronized with the file being read.

     solution: added a call to go back to parent directory when treating an ignored directory

     affects versions: 1.0.0, 1.0.1
     fixed in version: 1.0.2
