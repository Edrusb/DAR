KNOWN BUGS :

#1 : Description : files pointed to by a symbolic links get their times
	 (mtime & atime) not properly restored
	   
     problem : when restoring time of a symbolic link the utime() system call
	does not change the inode of the symbolic link itself but the one of 
	the file pointed to by the symbolic link

     solution : as the utime() call behaves the same on many Unix plateforms,
	(HP-UX, solaris, Linux, etc.), the times for the symbolic links are
	no more restored, thus files pointed to by symbolic links are not 
	affected by the utime() strange behaviour. Dar, behaves not the 
	same as touch, tar, etc.

     fixed in : version 1.0.1
