This is development code based on 2.5.x releases which includes binary delta feature,
which will be officially part of next major release: 2.6.0

Read the included dar man page to know how to use this feature, check also the
documentation under the doc subdirectory

Archive generated with this code may not be readable using future release 2.6.x and later
version, due to other new feature that will be added in the meanwhile.

It is not a good idea to use archives generated by this code for long terme storage,
while code seems stable enough to be used for temporary backups (keep a copy of the source code
used in your stuff as this branch will be merged to master branch, then removed).

No (or little) support will be assured for that code, this is development code, I repeat!
