This branch contain development code, no forward compatibility will be assured,
so this is not a good idea to use it for long terme storage, while it may
be possible to use for temporary backups instead (keep a copy of the source code
used in your stuff as this branch will be merged to master branch, then removed).

No support will be assured for that software, this is development code!

If you want to use delta binary / rsync increment feature for your production
environment please wait for release 2.6.0 which will contain this feature.

Archive generated with this code may not be readable using release 2.6.x and later
version, due to other new feature that will be added before release 2.6.0 takes
place.
