.SH NAME
dar_cp \- 'cp' clone command that is able to copy data located after an I/O error
.SH SYNOPSIS
dar_cp <source file> <destination file>
.P
dar_cp -h
.P
dar_cp -V
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dar_cp
is similar to the standard 'cp' command, except it does not stop copying when an I/O error is met. Instead, it skips a bit further and continues to copy the rest of the file, as much as possible, filling the gaps by zeroed bytes.

.PP
.B dar_cp
only accepts full filename (not directory) as argument. The reason of its
existence in dar package is that you need it if you use Parchive with dar
and have a corruption on a CD-R or any other read-only medium. You need to copy
the corrupted slice on a read-write filesystem, for Parchive be able to repair
it using slice associated redundancy files.
