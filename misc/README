What will you find in this directory?

--------------------
| IMPORTANT!
|   as there is so many distro today (yep, the Slackware hegemony is over...)
|   I do not produce anymore binary packages. Ask your preferred distro
|   maintainer team to upgrade their packages or wait for they do so.
--------------------

many script that help(ed) build the releases:
- batch_cygwin
- batch_linux  (deprecated)
- match_linux_ea (deprecated)
- make_cygwin_dist (invoked by batch_cygwin)

a helper program to translate documentation to DOS/Windows text format
- todos.c

a helper program to list argument passed to a given command
- Args/args.c
This one was used on dar-support mailing-list to troubleshoot
arguments passed to dar from a user defined script

a heler script to run make check, which failes from time to time
for some reason related to libgcrypt at archive creating time,
problem is under investigation...
- dar_check
and an helper script to test dar_check
- failer

A complementary pair of scripts to install a package (main target software
being dar) and ease its removal, into an environement without package management
and without developement tools (else "make install-strip/uninstall" would have
done the job).
- prepare_install
- finish_install

The first installs the software into a temp directory and builds a dar archive
of it. The second with the assitance of dar_static first extract the archive
into a temporary directory, compares the generated tree to setup a removal
script and then proceed to a restricted restoration of the archive to not
touch path leading to the restored files. The generated script can be sourced
from a bash shell at a later time to only remove what has been installed.
